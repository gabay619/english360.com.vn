1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,032
And now, you were with your co-star in the new movie, Ryan Guzman?

2
00:00:05,032 --> 00:00:05,094
Ryan Guzman, yeah.

3
00:00:05,096 --> 00:00:07,036
All right. He’s a good-looking guy.

4
00:00:07,038 --> 00:00:08,008
He’s very cute.

5
00:00:08,006 --> 00:00:09,038
Have you seen this guy?

6
00:00:13,018 --> 00:00:17,064
He’s so fun. He’s a real sweet, he’s a gentleman.

7
00:00:17,064 --> 00:00:19,056
We’re doing all this promo together for the movie.

8
00:00:19,098 --> 00:00:22,046
So we walked the carpet at the Globes together.

9
00:00:22,046 --> 00:00:23,048
So there’s nothing going on?

10
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:25,018
No, no, no, no, no.

11
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:25,018
Cause people of course assume that cause you’re with him….

12
00:00:25,018 --> 00:00:26,016
- Yeah.

13
00:00:25,072 --> 00:00:26,008
- No, always, always.

14
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:27,042
No, but we arrived separately.

15
00:00:27,042 --> 00:00:29,082
But then later we went to the parties together, and we had some fun.

16
00:00:29,082 --> 00:00:30,042
And it was good.

17
00:00:30,092 --> 00:00:31,018
Yeah.

18
00:00:31,018 --> 00:00:32,010
Does he have a girlfriend?

19
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:36,006
I think he might. I’m not sure. I know he did.

20
00:00:36,032 --> 00:00:37,022
Mm hmm.

21
00:00:39,006 --> 00:00:40,028
What?

22
00:00:41,028 --> 00:00:44,026
I… No, I’m not, I’m just, I’m not in his business like that.

23
00:00:45,072 --> 00:00:47,038
Uh-huh. Not yet.

24
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,074
Now why not?

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,006
What’s the heck? What’s going on around here?

26
00:00:56,034 --> 00:00:59,096
I don’t know. We just have all these posters laying around backstage.

27
00:00:59,098 --> 00:01:01,016
Yeah. Just pop ‘em up.

28
00:01:01,016 --> 00:01:03,042
Yeah. Um…

29
00:01:05,008 --> 00:01:06,004
How old is he?

30
00:01:05,008 --> 00:01:06,004
That’s very funny.

31
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:11,004
He’s … somewhere – I … 25, 26 maybe.

32
00:01:11,028 --> 00:01:12,062
Seemed older.

33
00:01:12,062 --> 00:01:16,090
Yeah. …. So much older.

34
00:01:18,002 --> 00:01:20,068
Um. But see, that’s what the whole movie’s about, too.

35
00:01:20,068 --> 00:01:21,084
There’s nothing wrong with that.

36
00:01:21,084 --> 00:01:24,070
- And you talk about that in this issue of SELF Magazine.

37
00:01:24,024 --> 00:01:25,018
- There’s nothing wrong with that.

38
00:01:24,094 --> 00:01:25,072
- Is there nothing wrong with that? Yeah…

39
00:01:25,072 --> 00:01:29,040
No, I hate that they have, like, a label for a woman who would date a younger guy.

40
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,094
If a younger guy’s interested in you, what’s the big deal?

41
00:01:31,094 --> 00:01:35,030
But we… What’s the word for the man who’s, like, after the younger girls?

42
00:01:36,032 --> 00:01:38,060
And, like, I’m not after younger guys.

43
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:40,096
If the younger guys like me, then that’s one thing, you know?

44
00:01:41,026 --> 00:01:45,026
But there’s, like, guys who just go after younger women. They have no name, no label.

45
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:47,072
No, and they’ve been doing it forever.

46
00:01:46,098 --> 00:01:48,028
And you can date one person.

47
00:01:48,082 --> 00:01:49,030
Label.

48
00:01:49,088 --> 00:01:50,036
Right?

49
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,068
And also maybe that’s just the person that you happen to get along with,

50
00:01:54,082 --> 00:01:58,090
and even if it is more than one person, it doesn’t mean you should be labeled.

51
00:01:58,090 --> 00:02:00,018
Right, right, I agree.

52
00:02:00,018 --> 00:02:01,066
It just means that’s who you’re connecting with.

53
00:02:01,066 --> 00:02:03,066
I think it’s a … there’s just a little bit of an imbalance. They’re not fair.
