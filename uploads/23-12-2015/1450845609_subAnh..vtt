00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.032
And now, you were with your co-star in the new movie, Ryan Guzman?

00:00:05.032 --> 00:00:05.094
Ryan Guzman, yeah.

00:00:05.096 --> 00:00:07.036
All right. He’s a good-looking guy.

00:00:07.038 --> 00:00:08.008
He’s very cute.

00:00:08.006 --> 00:00:09.038
Have you seen this guy?

00:00:13.018 --> 00:00:17.064
He’s so fun. He’s a real sweet, he’s a gentleman.

00:00:17.064 --> 00:00:19.056
We’re doing all this promo together for the movie.

00:00:19.098 --> 00:00:22.046
So we walked the carpet at the Globes together.

00:00:22.046 --> 00:00:23.048
So there’s nothing going on?

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:25.018
Cause people of course assume that cause you’re with him….

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:25.018
No, no, no, no, no.

00:00:25.018 --> 00:00:26.016
- Yeah.

00:00:25.072 --> 00:00:26.008
- No, always, always.

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:27.042
No, but we arrived separately.

00:00:27.042 --> 00:00:29.082
But then later we went to the parties together, and we had some fun.

00:00:29.082 --> 00:00:30.042
And it was good.

00:00:30.092 --> 00:00:31.018
Yeah.

00:00:31.018 --> 00:00:32.010
Does he have a girlfriend?

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:36.006
I think he might. I’m not sure. I know he did.

00:00:36.032 --> 00:00:37.022
Mm hmm.

00:00:39.006 --> 00:00:40.028
What?

00:00:41.028 --> 00:00:44.026
I… No, I’m not, I’m just, I’m not in his business like that.

00:00:45.072 --> 00:00:47.038
Uh-huh. Not yet.

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:50.074
Now why not?

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.006
What’s the heck? What’s going on around here?

00:00:56.034 --> 00:00:59.096
I don’t know. We just have all these posters laying around backstage.

00:00:59.098 --> 00:01:01.016
Yeah. Just pop ‘em up.

00:01:01.016 --> 00:01:03.042
Yeah. Um…

00:01:05.008 --> 00:01:06.004
How old is he?

00:01:05.008 --> 00:01:06.004
That’s very funny.

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.004
He’s … somewhere – I … 25, 26 maybe.

00:01:11.028 --> 00:01:12.062
Seemed older.

00:01:12.062 --> 00:01:16.090
Yeah. …. So much older.

00:01:18.002 --> 00:01:20.068
Um. But see, that’s what the whole movie’s about, too.

00:01:20.068 --> 00:01:21.084
There’s nothing wrong with that.

00:01:21.084 --> 00:01:24.070
- And you talk about that in this issue of SELF Magazine.

00:01:24.024 --> 00:01:25.018
- There’s nothing wrong with that.

00:01:24.094 --> 00:01:25.072
- Is there nothing wrong with that? Yeah…

00:01:25.072 --> 00:01:29.040
No, I hate that they have, like, a label for a woman who would date a younger guy.

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.094
If a younger guy’s interested in you, what’s the big deal?

00:01:31.094 --> 00:01:35.030
But we… What’s the word for the man who’s, like, after the younger girls?

00:01:36.032 --> 00:01:38.060
And, like, I’m not after younger guys.

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.096
If the younger guys like me, then that’s one thing, you know?

00:01:41.026 --> 00:01:45.026
But there’s, like, guys who just go after younger women. They have no name, no label.

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:47.072
No, and they’ve been doing it forever.

00:01:46.098 --> 00:01:48.028
And you can date one person.

00:01:48.082 --> 00:01:49.030
Label.

00:01:49.088 --> 00:01:50.036
Right?

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.068
And also maybe that’s just the person that you happen to get along with,

00:01:54.082 --> 00:01:58.090
and even if it is more than one person, it doesn’t mean you should be labeled.

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:00.018
Right, right, I agree.

00:02:00.018 --> 00:02:01.066
It just means that’s who you’re connecting with.

00:02:01.066 --> 00:02:03.066
I think it’s a … there’s just a little bit of an imbalance. They’re not fair.
