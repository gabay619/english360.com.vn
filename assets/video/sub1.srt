1
00:01:53,013 --> 00:01:54,781
Welcome! Welcome!

2
00:01:54,848 --> 00:01:56,116
Congrats, Drac.

3
00:01:56,183 --> 00:01:59,419
Holy smokes, everybody's here.

4
00:01:59,486 --> 00:02:01,922
Mr. and Mrs. Loughran,
the parents of the groom, and family.

5
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:08,729
Mom and Dad!
Johnny!

6
00:02:08,794 --> 00:02:10,530
I can't believe
you're all here.

7
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:34,354
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah!

8
00:02:35,555 --> 00:02:37,591
Yo, how hot is my date?

9
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:39,426
So hot. Wow.

10
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:40,861
How 'bout how hot mine is?

11
00:02:40,927 --> 00:02:42,829
You got a date?

12
00:02:42,896 --> 00:02:45,999
Yeah. She's invisible.
That's why you can't see her.

13
00:02:46,066 --> 00:02:47,666
Oh, right. This is
the one from "Canada"?

14
00:02:48,802 --> 00:02:49,836
Wedding's starting.

15
00:02:58,879 --> 00:02:59,880
Ah!

16
00:03:03,817 --> 00:03:04,851
Oh!

17
00:03:08,555 --> 00:03:09,555
Aw!

18
00:03:46,793 --> 00:03:48,228
Whoo-hoo!

19
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:50,229
Great.

20
00:03:58,004 --> 00:04:00,307
True. So true, Marty.

21
00:04:00,373 --> 00:04:01,541
Aw!

22
00:04:15,555 --> 00:04:16,990
Aw. How sweet.

23
00:04:19,993 --> 00:04:21,595
Oh, my. Look at you.

24
00:04:23,196 --> 00:04:24,196
Oh, my gosh.

25
00:04:25,498 --> 00:04:26,498
Oh.

26
00:04:38,845 --> 00:04:41,881
Is it everything you wanted,
my little poisonberry?

27
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:43,416
Oh, it is, Daddy.

28
00:04:44,251 --> 00:04:46,453
Except where's Grandpa Vlad?

29
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:48,989
Honey, your gramps
would not have been cool with this.

30
00:04:49,055 --> 00:04:50,790
He's old-school.

31
00:04:50,857 --> 00:04:53,193
How do we know?
If he could just meet Johnny...

32
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:54,961
He would have eaten him.

33
00:04:55,028 --> 00:04:57,897
He's not as
enlightened as your hip Daddy.

34
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:01,368
So, you're really okay
with him not being a monster?

35
00:05:01,434 --> 00:05:05,405
Human, monster, unicorn,
as long as you're happy.

36
00:05:06,573 --> 00:05:07,641
Thanks, Dad.

Hey, Dad.

46
00:05:54,454 --> 00:05:55,555
Oh, hey, guys!

47
00:05:55,622 --> 00:05:57,090
Todd, take a break.

48
00:06:00,961 --> 00:06:02,462
So, what's up?

49
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:05,932
Mavis was wondering
if maybe you wanted to go for a fly.

50
00:06:05,999 --> 00:06:10,170
Oh. We haven't done that in forever.
Any special reason?

51
00:06:10,236 --> 00:06:11,738
No special reason at all.

52
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:14,040
Right, Mavey?

53
00:06:14,841 --> 00:06:15,942
What's his deal?

54
00:06:16,009 --> 00:06:17,310
He's silly.

55
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:19,346
It's just
a beautiful night, and...

56
00:06:19,412 --> 00:06:21,081
Well, if you don't want to...

57
00:06:21,147 --> 00:06:22,615
No, no! Are you kidding?

58
00:06:22,682 --> 00:06:25,185
I would eat a bucket of
garlic to fly with you.

59
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,123
Oh, honey,
look at those fluffy clouds.

60
00:07:04,691 --> 00:07:07,260
Remember what we played
when you were little?

61
00:07:07,327 --> 00:07:10,130
Hide and go
seek sharp objects?

62
00:07:10,196 --> 00:07:13,800
Okay.
Regular hide and go seek.

63
00:07:16,302 --> 00:07:17,804
Where are you?

64
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,142
Honeybat!

65
00:07:24,177 --> 00:07:25,345
Mavey!

66
00:07:27,147 --> 00:07:28,548
Honeybat!

67
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:32,285
I'm gonna get you.

68
00:07:38,158 --> 00:07:40,360
Honey?
Are you okay?

69
00:07:40,427 --> 00:07:42,328
Yes.
It's just a little harder

70
00:07:42,395 --> 00:07:44,564
to catch my breath
since I'm pregnant.

71
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:46,966
Yes, well, I guess
that would make it more...

72
00:07:47,033 --> 00:07:48,101
What?

73
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:57,677
I'm gonna be a Grandpa!

74
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:02,449
And I'm gonna be a Dad!

75
00:08:04,217 --> 00:08:07,020
<i>♪ 'Cause you're

76
00:08:07,086 --> 00:08:09,956
<i>♪ Daddy's girl, or boy</i>

77
00:08:10,023 --> 00:08:11,758
I'm hungry again, honey.

78
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:13,585
Can you get me
some ice cream with anchovies?

79
00:08:15,795 --> 00:08:18,164
No, no, no. You mustn't give
in to your cravings.

80
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:20,400
It's not good for the baby.

81
00:08:20,467 --> 00:08:22,502
You need to increase
your spider intake,

82
00:08:22,569 --> 00:08:24,003
so he'll be able to
climb ceilings properly.

83
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:25,738
And eat lots of sheep bile.

84
00:08:27,774 --> 00:08:29,609
I love you,
Dad, but we don't even know

85
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:31,711
if the kid's gonna be a vampire.

86
00:08:31,778 --> 00:08:34,714
I'd be thrilled if the baby's human-y,
just like Johnny.

87
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:37,917
"Human-y." With thousands
of years of Dracula genes.

88
00:08:37,984 --> 00:08:39,251
Not gonna happen.

89
00:08:39,318 --> 00:08:41,254
As long as the baby's healthy.

90
00:08:41,321 --> 00:08:43,690
Of course.
A healthy little vampire.

91
00:08:43,756 --> 00:08:44,824
Or human.

92
00:08:44,891 --> 00:08:47,894
Yes, a human who can
fly as a bat.

93
00:08:47,961 --> 00:08:50,563
Here. Just have
some monster ball soup.

94
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:52,499
It's your mommy's recipe.

95
00:08:55,401 --> 00:08:56,401
Aw!

96
00:08:57,003 --> 00:08:59,138
Thank you, Dad.

97
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:02,342
Just like you made it when
I was a kid. My favorite.

98
00:09:14,187 --> 00:09:15,188
Sorry.

99
00:09:30,303 --> 00:09:33,173
Sir, only the father is allowed
in the delivery room.

100
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:35,508
Really? I mean, okay.

101
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:37,677
He's the family, I guess.

102
00:09:43,349 --> 00:09:46,619
Oh, look!
It's a boy! It's a boy!

103
00:09:46,686 --> 00:09:50,490
The Dracula
bloodline carries on!

104
00:09:50,557 --> 00:09:53,893
No one will ever harm you
as long as I'm here,

105
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,129
my little devil dog.

106
00:09:56,196 --> 00:09:57,730
Dad, can I hold my baby?

107
00:09:57,797 --> 00:10:00,066
If I were Dad,
I'd say yes.

108
00:10:00,133 --> 00:10:02,502
But I'm the nurse,
Francine.

109
00:10:02,569 --> 00:10:04,604
Here you go anyway.

110
00:10:10,076 --> 00:10:12,946
My bad.

111
00:10:17,517 --> 00:10:19,686
Little Dennis is
a year old now. Wow!

112
00:10:23,523 --> 00:10:25,725
Nice. Yeah. Cute kid.

113
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:32,265
Okay, time for presents, guys.

114
00:10:32,332 --> 00:10:35,935
All right!
Let's do this boy up!

115
00:10:36,002 --> 00:10:38,071
Check out what I got him.
Bling!

116
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:40,039
Wow. Is it cursed?

117
00:10:40,106 --> 00:10:42,075
Super cursed.
Only the best.

118
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:44,344
Straight from the crypt.

119
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:48,014
He's just starting to walk,
so maybe it's heavier than...

120
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:52,752
Oh. You're okay, Denisovich.

121
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:55,388
His name is Dennis.
Named after my father.

122
00:10:55,455 --> 00:10:57,590
It's not his vampire name.

123
00:10:57,657 --> 00:11:00,059
My little
Denisovichy-weesovichy.

124
00:11:00,126 --> 00:11:02,829
Huh!
Are we sure he's a vampire?

125
00:11:02,895 --> 00:11:04,831
I mean,
not that it's a bad thing,

126
00:11:04,897 --> 00:11:09,135
but shouldn't he have fangs
and that pasty skin you guys have?

127
00:11:09,202 --> 00:11:12,639
Technically, you have until you're five
to get your vampire fangs.

128
00:11:12,705 --> 00:11:14,574
Oh, he'll get his fangs.
He's a Dracula.

129
00:11:14,641 --> 00:11:16,909
He's also half Loughran.

130
00:11:16,976 --> 00:11:19,979
Maybe he'd be better off where we live.
There's more humans there.

131
00:11:20,046 --> 00:11:23,416
What? Look how well he's playing
with the wolf pups.

132
00:11:26,886 --> 00:11:30,356
We have a present.
I hope it's acceptable.

133
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:33,159
"My first guillotine."

134
00:11:33,226 --> 00:11:36,329
Very educational.
Well played, Frank.

135
00:11:36,396 --> 00:11:39,666
It's great. Thank you.
We just have to baby-proof that.

136
00:11:42,001 --> 00:11:44,070
Johnny, do you know
where you put the rubber guards?

137
00:11:45,271 --> 00:11:47,106
Baby-proofing a guillotine?

138
00:11:47,173 --> 00:11:50,710
So you cut your finger off.
It's part of the fun.

139
00:11:50,777 --> 00:11:53,112
She made me
baby-proof the whole hotel.

140
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:55,581
Someone's overprotective.

141
00:12:07,927 --> 00:12:08,927
Aah!

142
00:12:09,128 --> 00:12:10,128
Hmm?

143
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:22,575
Johnny! Come quick!

144
00:12:25,311 --> 00:12:27,146
What's up? He's okay?

145
00:12:27,213 --> 00:12:28,548
Dennis said
his first word!

146
00:12:29,048 --> 00:12:30,450
He did?

147
00:12:30,516 --> 00:12:32,485
Come on, honey.
Say it again.

148
00:12:32,552 --> 00:12:33,553
Bleh, bleh-bleh.

149
00:12:34,954 --> 00:12:37,457
I don't say,
"bleh, bleh-bleh."

150
00:12:38,391 --> 00:12:40,226
We didn't say you did.

151
00:12:40,293 --> 00:12:41,333
Then where did
he get that?

152
00:12:41,361 --> 00:12:42,662
Bleh, bleh-bleh.

153
00:12:42,729 --> 00:12:44,997
Well,
maybe sometimes you say it.

154
00:12:45,064 --> 00:12:47,066
I only say it when I
say I don't say it!

155
00:12:47,567 --> 00:12:49,068
Bleh, bleh-bleh.

156
00:12:49,135 --> 00:12:51,571
Okay, kid.
We get it. You can talk.

157
00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:54,807
Denisovich.

158
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:57,510
Dad.

159
00:12:57,577 --> 00:12:58,657
Just checking for cavities.

160
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:03,449
Bleh, bleh-bleh.

161
00:13:03,516 --> 00:13:04,717
Bleh, bleh-bleh.

162
00:13:05,351 --> 00:13:06,819
It was you!

163
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:18,965
Oh, my goodness, Leonard.

164
00:13:19,031 --> 00:13:20,900
If you really
looked that hideous,

165
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:22,735
I don't think I
could hang out with you.

166
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:24,337
Guys, what's the deal?

167
00:13:24,404 --> 00:13:27,306
Is this a party?
Pick up a phone.

168
00:13:27,373 --> 00:13:32,578
I don't care if Johnny said it's a
"cool app." Johnny's still new here.

169
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:35,948
Now, porridge head, did you call a
hearse for the gremlinbergs?

170
00:13:36,015 --> 00:13:39,452
No, you're checking
your Facebook page. Again.

171
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:41,254
Drac,
I told the guys social media

172
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,789
is the best way to
promote the hotel.

173
00:13:42,855 --> 00:13:44,056
Right, Clifton?

174
00:13:46,025 --> 00:13:48,227
So, Drac, I wanted
to go through some thoughts I had,

175
00:13:48,294 --> 00:13:51,297
as your new human relations
coordinating co-assistant.

176
00:13:51,364 --> 00:13:52,698
Sure. It's a real job.

177
00:13:52,765 --> 00:13:55,768
Not a cheap excuse to keep Mavis happy,
so you never leave here.

178
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:58,404
Right. So,
I was thinking,

179
00:13:58,471 --> 00:14:02,441
since we have so many humans now,
maybe update some of the acts?

180
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:03,910
Like, maybe the magician?

181
00:14:03,976 --> 00:14:05,978
What's wrong with
Harry three-eye?

182
00:14:06,045 --> 00:14:09,182
Well, he might be a little old-school
for the humans.

183
00:14:09,248 --> 00:14:11,250
Tell me,
sir, what was your card?

184
00:14:11,317 --> 00:14:12,785
The three of spades?

185
00:14:14,754 --> 00:14:16,956
Is this your card, my friend?

186
00:14:17,723 --> 00:14:18,891
Whoa!

187
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,662
No, Harry's great.

188
00:14:22,728 --> 00:14:24,864
Can't blame Harry
for the crowd not being hip.

189
00:14:24,931 --> 00:14:27,033
Okay, what about Wayne?

190
00:14:27,099 --> 00:14:28,701
Wayne? Are you nuts?
He's my boy.

191
00:14:28,768 --> 00:14:30,670
Then maybe something
other than tennis?

192
00:14:30,736 --> 00:14:32,872
Okay, so, what you wanna do

193
00:14:32,939 --> 00:14:36,409
is lift the racket right on impact, so
you get that nice top spin.

194
00:14:36,476 --> 00:14:37,944
Try and hit one.

195
00:14:46,786 --> 00:14:49,722
What is that?
What's the noise? It's on me!

196
00:14:49,789 --> 00:14:51,691
It's just
the cell phone I got you.

197
00:14:51,757 --> 00:14:54,760
Clifton's sending you a text
so you can practice how to write back.

198
00:14:54,827 --> 00:14:55,995
Oh!

199
00:14:57,463 --> 00:14:58,731
Eh...

200
00:14:58,798 --> 00:14:59,999
What the...
It's not doing it.

201
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:01,100
I got it.

202
00:15:06,606 --> 00:15:07,707
Now you can text Clifton.

203
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:10,009
All right, fine.

204
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:12,778
How do you do this?

205
00:15:12,845 --> 00:15:13,965
Maybe it's your fingernails.

206
00:15:14,013 --> 00:15:16,415
It's easy.
Look. I'll text Mavis.

207
00:15:16,482 --> 00:15:19,352
Psyched for date night.

208
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:21,687
See? And now look,
she texted right back.

209
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:23,890
"Gotta cancel.
Can't leave Dennis."

210
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:25,825
Okay.

211
00:15:25,892 --> 00:15:30,563
Are we never
allowed to be alone again?

212
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:34,433
I need to feel loved, too.

213
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:37,236
And send.

214
00:15:37,303 --> 00:15:40,573
Okay. All that taught me
is that you're pathetic.

215
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,875
Yeah, got it. Maybe you should
just get Bluetooth.

216
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:45,244
Okay.
Blue tooth, come over here.

217
00:15:48,314 --> 00:15:49,615
So, now what?

218
00:15:54,086 --> 00:15:56,389
Rise and shine, my Denisovich.

219
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:58,157
Hi, Papa.

220
00:15:58,224 --> 00:16:01,561
Hello, my little devil.
Did you have sweet nightmares?

221
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:05,431
Uh-huh. I dreamed
that I saw a stegosaurus.

222
00:16:05,498 --> 00:16:07,667
Oh... and were you
drinking his blood?

223
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:09,635
No.

224
00:16:09,702 --> 00:16:10,970
Just throwing it out there.

225
00:16:11,037 --> 00:16:12,505
Hey! You want to
do something cool?

226
00:16:12,571 --> 00:16:15,141
Yeah!

227
00:16:15,207 --> 00:16:19,745
I'm going to teach you
how to turn into a bat. Like me.

228
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:21,647
See?
Cool.

229
00:16:21,714 --> 00:16:23,349
Yes! Cool, like I said.

230
00:16:24,183 --> 00:16:25,318
Now you try.

231
00:16:26,218 --> 00:16:27,820
I'm a bat.

232
00:16:27,887 --> 00:16:29,755
I'm a bat.
I'm a bat. I'm a bat.

233
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:30,957
I'm a bat.

234
00:16:31,724 --> 00:16:33,292
I mean, a real bat.

235
00:16:33,359 --> 00:16:34,827
I'm a bat!

236
00:16:36,762 --> 00:16:41,267
Denisovich. Take a breath.
You can really turn into a bat.

237
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:43,369
Try. Feel the bat.

238
00:16:45,738 --> 00:16:47,239
Not a chicken.

239
00:16:49,709 --> 00:16:51,744
What's that?
The electric boogaloo?

240
00:16:51,811 --> 00:16:54,680
If I show you I can bust a move,
will you try to fly, then?

241
00:16:54,747 --> 00:16:55,747
Uh-huh.

242
00:17:10,627 --> 00:17:12,431
Dad? Why are you guys dancing?

243
00:17:13,598 --> 00:17:15,800
Uh, he was sleep-dancing.

244
00:17:15,867 --> 00:17:17,236
Come on, sweetie.
Back to bed.

245
00:17:17,303 --> 00:17:20,239
"Back to bed"?
It's already after 8:00 P.M.

246
00:17:20,306 --> 00:17:22,241
Don't you remember
the new sleep schedule?

247
00:17:22,308 --> 00:17:23,209
He's going to human
classes half the day.

248
00:17:23,275 --> 00:17:25,044
Uh...

249
00:17:25,111 --> 00:17:28,114
If he could just sleep till 2:00 A.M.
tonight, it'd be so great for him.

250
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:30,116
But, honeydeath,
six of Wayne's wolf pups

251
00:17:30,182 --> 00:17:32,118
are having
a birthday party tonight.

252
00:17:32,184 --> 00:17:34,286
You wouldn't want
him to miss that.

253
00:17:34,353 --> 00:17:38,124
Dad, I love the wolf pups,
but they're a little too rough for Dennis.

254
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:40,426
"Too rough"?

255
00:17:40,493 --> 00:17:42,495
Haven't you noticed?
Dennis is different.

256
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:45,364
What are you saying?
Denisovich shouldn't be around monsters?

257
00:17:45,431 --> 00:17:48,668
I love monsters!
Video! Video! Ha!

258
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:50,836
Oh, you wanna show Papa Drac
your monster video?

259
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:51,903
Yeah!

260
00:17:54,774 --> 00:17:56,909
<i>Who's the coolest monster?</i>

261
00:17:56,976 --> 00:17:58,744
Kakie!

262
00:17:58,811 --> 00:18:01,781
<i>Wee! Kakie one happy monster!</i>

263
00:18:01,847 --> 00:18:04,383
<i>Kakie love cake! Yummy!</i>

264
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:06,786
<i>Tummy get a tummyache.</i>

265
00:18:06,852 --> 00:18:10,222
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
How is that a monster?

266
00:18:10,289 --> 00:18:12,391
<i>Have some cake,
wuzzlelumplebum.</i>

267
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:16,362
<i>Remember, kids,
a real monster always shares.</i>

268
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:21,233
"Shares"? Yes! When I think monsters,
I think "shares."

269
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:24,804
Now, let me tell you
what a real monster is, Denisovich.

270
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:28,474
Dad, please. He's practically five already.
Don't force it.

271
00:18:32,344 --> 00:18:34,580
<i>Slow down, wuzzlelumplebum.</i>

272
00:18:40,052 --> 00:18:43,622
<i>? Twinkle,
Twinkle, little star how I wonder?</i>

273
00:18:43,689 --> 00:18:46,158
Mommy,
I'm too old for lullabies.

274
00:18:46,225 --> 00:18:48,394
What?
That's not how that one goes.

275
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:50,029
This is the way
most people sing it.

276
00:18:50,096 --> 00:18:52,298
"Most people"?
What's wrong with...

277
00:18:52,364 --> 00:18:55,801
<i>♪ Suffer, suffer,
scream in pain</i>

278
00:18:55,868 --> 00:18:59,238
<i>♪ Blood is spilling
from your brain?</i>

279
00:18:59,305 --> 00:19:02,007
Daddy. Come on. You know
how I sang it to you.

280
00:19:02,074 --> 00:19:05,211
<i>♪ Zombies gnaw you
like a plum</i>

281
00:19:05,277 --> 00:19:08,414
<i>♪ Piercing cries
and you succumb</i>

282
00:19:10,049 --> 00:19:13,953
<i>♪ Suffer, suffer,
scream in pain</i>

283
00:19:14,019 --> 00:19:19,058
<i>♪ You will never
breathe again?</i>

284
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:22,528
Still works.

285
00:19:42,781 --> 00:19:43,849
Oh...

286
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:47,853
Happy birthday,
Wally, Wilson,

287
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,855
Whoopi,
Waylon, Weepy and Wanye.

288
00:19:51,557 --> 00:19:54,160
Denisovich!
My big boy! You made it!

289
00:19:55,161 --> 00:19:57,396
I thought about
what you said, Dad.

290
00:19:57,463 --> 00:19:59,198
Maybe I was being
a little overprotective.

291
00:19:59,265 --> 00:20:01,167
Thank you, coffin cake.

292
00:20:02,168 --> 00:20:03,803
Dennis! I love you! Zing!

293
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:05,404
Hi, winnie.

294
00:20:05,471 --> 00:20:08,607
I just love your yummy strawberry locks!
Zing, zing!

295
00:20:11,777 --> 00:20:15,648
Winnie. Give him his space, hon.
I'm sorry, Mavis.

296
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:18,384
It's okay, aunt Wanda.
They're just playing.

297
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:22,154
Holy rabies! Limbo?
I used to love that game!

298
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:24,056
Get in there, Mavey.

299
00:20:24,123 --> 00:20:25,724
Really? But I'm a parent now.

300
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:27,159
Show 'em how it's done.

301
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:28,460
Okay. Okay, okay.

302
00:20:37,469 --> 00:20:39,071
No way! A pinata?

303
00:20:42,942 --> 00:20:44,677
Oh, Mavis, honey.
That's for later.

304
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:46,645
Whoo!

305
00:20:46,712 --> 00:20:48,352
We don't want
the pups to have too much...

306
00:20:48,814 --> 00:20:50,249
Candy!

307
00:20:53,852 --> 00:20:54,852
Sugar.

308
00:21:02,561 --> 00:21:04,597
I'm sorry.
Did I start all that?

309
00:21:04,663 --> 00:21:06,703
Don't worry. There's a reason
they call it a litter.

310
00:21:16,542 --> 00:21:17,542
Whoa!

311
00:21:18,844 --> 00:21:20,813
Dennis! Are you okay?

312
00:21:20,879 --> 00:21:22,781
I got a candy.

313
00:21:22,848 --> 00:21:24,750
Look! Your tooth came out.

314
00:21:24,817 --> 00:21:27,253
Are you kidding me?
He got his tooth knocked out?

315
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:30,356
Oh, yes, indeed.
Here comes the fang.

316
00:21:30,422 --> 00:21:33,525
Dad. His baby tooth wasn't a fang.
Why would this one be?

317
00:21:33,592 --> 00:21:35,160
He's not a monster.

318
00:21:37,463 --> 00:21:38,463
Ooh!

319
00:21:40,099 --> 00:21:43,135
The sun's gonna come out soon,
and we gotta get to his classes.

320
00:21:43,202 --> 00:21:46,939
What's wrong with the classes we have here?
Like the kids' yoga?

321
00:21:47,006 --> 00:21:51,043
Yoga!

322
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:53,178
This is Denisovich's home.

323
00:21:53,245 --> 00:21:54,780
I don't know, Dad.

324
00:21:54,847 --> 00:21:56,215
What don't you know?

325
00:21:56,282 --> 00:21:59,752
Well, we've been
talking about moving.

326
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:02,254
Somewhere safer for Dennis.

327
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:05,224
Maybe where Johnny
grew up in California.

328
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:09,161
I'm sorry, but you can't
just make somebody something they're not.

329
00:22:11,297 --> 00:22:12,765
Come on, honey.
We have to go.

330
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:14,033
Zing, zing?

331
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:17,970
Mavey, wait.
You can't mean that.

332
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,242
You're in on this?
The leaving?

333
00:22:23,309 --> 00:22:26,145
Uh...
It's not definite at all.

334
00:22:26,211 --> 00:22:27,413
It's just something
she's definitely talking about,

335
00:22:27,479 --> 00:22:29,715
but until we do it,
it's not definitized.

336
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:35,120
Did he just cover
me with birdseed?

337
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:37,423
Yeah, he covered me.

338
00:22:47,733 --> 00:22:50,469
Dad, it's not a fang.

339
00:22:50,536 --> 00:22:53,672
Dad, I don't know
if it's the right place for Dennis.

340
00:22:53,739 --> 00:22:55,374
Right, Johnny?

341
00:22:55,441 --> 00:22:58,677
Oh, hey, dudeman.
It's not me. It's Mavey.

342
00:22:58,744 --> 00:23:02,114
Hey, dudeman.
I'm afraid to say anything.

343
00:23:02,181 --> 00:23:04,450
Hey, dudeman. I'm a dudeman!

344
00:23:04,516 --> 00:23:06,986
Uh, Drac? Who you talkin' to?

345
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:09,221
Do not disturb.
The count's wiggin' out in here.

346
00:23:10,656 --> 00:23:12,524
What are you
wiggin' out about, Drac?

347
00:23:12,591 --> 00:23:15,928
The kids. Mavey wavey's saying
she wants to leave.

348
00:23:15,995 --> 00:23:18,630
She wants to leave?
What about Johnny?
He doesn't wanna go.

349
00:23:18,697 --> 00:23:21,033
He's making
the hotel more human-y for Dennis.

350
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:22,868
You know, seeing
that he isn't a monster.

351
00:23:22,935 --> 00:23:24,303
He is a monster!

352
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:25,437
He's just a late fanger.

353
00:23:25,504 --> 00:23:26,538
Mmm-hmm.

354
00:23:26,605 --> 00:23:28,140
And I could be a hand model.

355
00:23:28,207 --> 00:23:30,442
Shut up!
It's all that human-y stuff

356
00:23:30,509 --> 00:23:34,046
that's confusing
poor Denisovich.

357
00:23:34,113 --> 00:23:37,249
So maybe you gotta get the kid
around more monster-y things. Ooh!

358
00:23:37,316 --> 00:23:39,451
Oh, I need a cape.

359
00:23:39,518 --> 00:23:42,621
I can't. She's always around,
checking up on me.

360
00:23:42,688 --> 00:23:45,924
Man, if you could
just get some alone time.

361
00:23:45,991 --> 00:23:48,360
Wait a minute.
That's what Johnny wants, too.

362
00:23:49,361 --> 00:23:51,530
Alone time with Mavis.

363
00:23:54,299 --> 00:23:55,501
Have
they even had a vacation

364
00:23:55,567 --> 00:23:57,069
since before
they were married?

365
00:24:01,073 --> 00:24:04,309
They're going to now.
And so are we. Frank, you're a genius.

366
00:24:16,088 --> 00:24:17,088
Mmm-hmm.

367
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:23,762
We'll take Denisovich
to all our old haunts.

368
00:24:25,664 --> 00:24:27,064
<i>Each of us will
show him our skills.</i>

369
00:24:29,201 --> 00:24:31,303
<i>Teach him how to be a monster.</i>

370
00:24:33,772 --> 00:24:36,308
And he'll be
fanging it up in no time.

371
00:24:36,375 --> 00:24:38,510
Boy turns five next week.

372
00:24:38,577 --> 00:24:41,113
If he's not a vampire by his birthday,
it ain't happenin'.

373
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:43,415
Oh, it ain't
ain't happening, baby.

374
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:45,818
All he needs is
time with his vampa.

375
00:24:45,884 --> 00:24:47,219
"Vampa"?

376
00:24:47,286 --> 00:24:48,620
Vampire Grandpa.

377
00:24:48,687 --> 00:24:50,622
Come on, man.
That's obvious.

378
00:24:53,025 --> 00:24:55,227
Johnny. Come outside.

379
00:24:55,294 --> 00:24:57,629
What? Who is it?

380
00:24:57,696 --> 00:25:00,199
It's your father-in-law.
I need to talk to you.

381
00:25:01,867 --> 00:25:02,868
What's up?

382
00:25:03,602 --> 00:25:04,603
Oh.

383
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:07,005
Let me get rid of them. Sorry.

384
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:10,175
No problem-o.
I was kinda diggin' the attention.

385
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:15,214
Can they stay?
I don't think they're ready to leave yet.

386
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,416
Come on. Go to your mother.

387
00:25:17,483 --> 00:25:18,684
Look,
you want to stay here, right?

388
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:20,519
Of course.

389
00:25:20,586 --> 00:25:23,255
This is the first place
where I can really be myself.

390
00:25:23,322 --> 00:25:26,758
I haven't felt this alive
since they invented stuffed-crust pizza.

391
00:25:26,825 --> 00:25:31,129
Well, then, we've got some work to do.
Okay, so here's the plan.

392
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:33,465
Maybe it's a good idea
to take her to your hometown.

393
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:35,767
But remember...

394
00:25:35,834 --> 00:25:38,670
So, it's sliced avocado,
rolled oats with apricot,

395
00:25:38,737 --> 00:25:41,039
the aveeno
moisturizer after every bath.

396
00:25:41,106 --> 00:25:44,409
And then the shea butter
on his tush before his pjs

397
00:25:44,476 --> 00:25:47,179
and then 20 minutes
with the nebulizer

398
00:25:47,246 --> 00:25:50,449
while I read his learning factory
phonics book to him.

399
00:25:50,516 --> 00:25:53,886
It's asking a lot, Dad.
We could just take Dennis with us.

400
00:25:53,952 --> 00:25:56,822
What? Are you kidding me?
And get him off his routine?

401
00:25:56,889 --> 00:25:58,190
No, no, no.

402
00:25:58,257 --> 00:26:00,292
You kids go to California,

403
00:26:00,359 --> 00:26:02,728
and see if it's the right place
to raise Denisovich.

404
00:26:02,794 --> 00:26:04,563
And you remember
how to video chat?

405
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:07,933
Yes, yes. With the phone
and the buttons and the agony.

406
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,870
Thanks for being so understanding, Dad.
I know you'll keep him safe.

407
00:26:11,937 --> 00:26:15,474
Of course, Mavey.
Stake my heart and hope to die.

408
00:26:15,541 --> 00:26:17,442
I'm just gonna
miss him so much.

409
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:20,212
I love you, Dennis.

410
00:26:20,279 --> 00:26:22,080
I love you, mommy.

411
00:26:22,147 --> 00:26:25,717
I'll tell him Mavey wavey stories
every night before bed.

412
00:26:25,784 --> 00:26:27,653
You're the best.
I love you, Dad.

413
00:26:30,956 --> 00:26:33,559
Gonna miss all you guys.
You're all my family.

414
00:26:34,293 --> 00:26:36,361
Love you, Drac.

415
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:38,730
Yes. I love you, too.

416
00:26:38,797 --> 00:26:42,501
Now, remember the plan.
Just keep her distracted and happy.

417
00:26:42,568 --> 00:26:45,003
<i>But not too happy, capisce?
Got it.</i>

418
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:47,606
Operation "just keep her
distracted and happy,

419
00:26:47,673 --> 00:26:50,976
<i>"but not too happy, capisce,"
starts now. Cool?</i>

420
00:26:51,043 --> 00:26:52,511
Smiling on the outside.

421
00:26:52,578 --> 00:26:53,679
Will you hug my backpack?

422
00:26:53,745 --> 00:26:54,745
No.

423
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:03,155
Back to bed.

424
00:27:03,222 --> 00:27:06,358
Ah, yes, we'll get to the bed.
We all love the bed.

425
00:27:06,425 --> 00:27:08,694
But we're just gonna
do one thing first.

426
00:27:12,598 --> 00:27:14,399
Is it shorts
weather where we're going?

427
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:17,135
Jeez. I hope not.
My body isn't swimsuit-ready yet.

428
00:27:17,202 --> 00:27:19,471
Whatever. Where's Griffin?

429
00:27:19,538 --> 00:27:21,819
Hey, can I have a second?
I'm just saying goodbye to Emily.

430
00:27:21,873 --> 00:27:23,508
Oh, brother.

431
00:27:23,575 --> 00:27:26,144
I'm gonna miss you so much.

432
00:27:26,211 --> 00:27:27,980
You know,
you have to be strong, honey.

433
00:27:28,046 --> 00:27:29,446
Because what we
have is unbreakable.

434
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:34,553
Babe, don't cry.
Everyone's looking.

435
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:36,221
Okay,
I gotta call him on this.

436
00:27:36,288 --> 00:27:39,258
Just let him play it out,
get it over with.

437
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:43,795
Okay, you two lovebirds.
Drink your champagne and let's get going.

438
00:27:43,862 --> 00:27:46,064
Oh, yeah.
No, sure. Okay.

439
00:27:46,131 --> 00:27:47,131
Cheers, babe.

440
00:27:49,234 --> 00:27:51,536
Oh. You klutz.

441
00:27:51,603 --> 00:27:53,672
We can't say
nothin' about this?

442
00:27:53,739 --> 00:27:55,099
No. We don't have
time for zingers.

443
00:28:03,582 --> 00:28:07,019
How do you click in
the stupid car seat?

444
00:28:07,085 --> 00:28:08,754
You gotta cut
those nails, man.

445
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:10,522
We just strap our
kids down with duct tape.

446
00:28:15,394 --> 00:28:16,995
What's he doing here?

447
00:28:17,062 --> 00:28:19,865
I told him he could come.
He's never been outside the hotel.

448
00:28:19,931 --> 00:28:22,634
Blobby, there's no room.
Sorry, man.

449
00:28:25,303 --> 00:28:27,005
Yeah, that ain't happenin'.

450
00:28:27,072 --> 00:28:29,708
Fine, put him on the rascal.
Let's just get going.

451
00:28:35,313 --> 00:28:36,348
Oh.

452
00:28:44,623 --> 00:28:47,025
Where are we going,
Papa Drac?

453
00:28:47,092 --> 00:28:49,494
Oh, Denisovich, we're going
to have an adventure.

454
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:51,730
A monster-y adventure.

455
00:28:51,797 --> 00:28:54,666
Yay! Monsters!
We're gonna eat cake.

456
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:56,768
What did he say?

457
00:28:56,835 --> 00:28:59,237
No.
No cake on this monster trip.

458
00:28:59,304 --> 00:29:02,841
No cake, cebause Kakie says,
"too much cake makes tummy ache."

459
00:29:03,175 --> 00:29:04,476
Yay!

460
00:29:04,543 --> 00:29:05,977
"A monster always shares."

461
00:29:07,646 --> 00:29:09,047
Wow!

462
00:29:09,114 --> 00:29:11,450
We may need
more than a week.

463
00:29:11,516 --> 00:29:14,686
Hey, you know who
could fix the kid in a snap? Vlad.

464
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:18,223
What?
We don't need to call Vlad.
We got this.

465
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:22,828
You see, Denisovich,
monsters are nice, just like you.

466
00:29:22,894 --> 00:29:27,099
But when the moon comes out,
the real monster fun begins.

467
00:29:28,934 --> 00:29:30,469
Being scary. Right, guys?

468
00:29:34,406 --> 00:29:35,766
Guys? Guys!
What is wrong with you?

469
00:29:37,709 --> 00:29:39,845
Come on.
Everybody likes that song.

470
00:29:39,911 --> 00:29:43,682
We're not everybody.
We're scary monsters. Remember?

471
00:29:43,749 --> 00:29:44,983
Hey, what are you putting in?

472
00:29:45,050 --> 00:29:46,518
It's an audio book.

473
00:29:46,585 --> 00:29:49,688
Bigfoot's life story.
He reads it himself.

474
00:29:49,755 --> 00:29:51,389
<i>Chapter one.</i>

475
00:30:23,789 --> 00:30:24,856
Wow!

476
00:30:24,923 --> 00:30:27,058
This is gonna be so amazing.

477
00:30:27,125 --> 00:30:30,162
Oh, yeah. You're gonna be so happy,
but not too happy.

478
00:30:30,228 --> 00:30:31,663
Huh?
What?

479
00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:33,999
I wanna see everything you did
growing up.

480
00:30:34,065 --> 00:30:36,201
<i>As long as you're distracted,
capisce?</i>

481
00:30:38,136 --> 00:30:39,704
We can hit a few spots
on the way to my parents.

482
00:30:39,771 --> 00:30:41,273
Lemme just quickly call home.

483
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:43,008
Ah! Don't do that.

484
00:30:43,074 --> 00:30:45,877
It's only 1:00 A.M. there.
Dennis isn't even up yet.

485
00:30:45,944 --> 00:30:49,214
Right. I'm just not used to
being away from him.

486
00:30:49,281 --> 00:30:51,716
Everything's gonna be cool.
Your Dad was so all over it.

487
00:30:51,783 --> 00:30:53,819
I know. He's the best.

488
00:31:14,506 --> 00:31:15,807
Right turn, here.

489
00:31:16,808 --> 00:31:18,643
Denisovich, rise and shine.

490
00:31:20,278 --> 00:31:22,881
Boys, this bringing
back any memories?

491
00:31:22,948 --> 00:31:26,218
We used to prowl around here
when we were in our 100s.

492
00:31:26,284 --> 00:31:29,588
The dark forest of Slobozia.

493
00:31:38,997 --> 00:31:40,632
Nice how they built it up.

494
00:31:40,699 --> 00:31:42,868
Okay, out of the car.

495
00:31:42,934 --> 00:31:45,470
Denisovich,
you're going to see

496
00:31:45,537 --> 00:31:48,039
every monster
do his specialty.

497
00:31:48,106 --> 00:31:51,743
First, Frank's gonna show us
how he scares people.

498
00:31:51,810 --> 00:31:54,579
Yay! He's gonna say, "boo."

499
00:31:54,646 --> 00:31:57,115
Yeah, I don't
think "boos" ever work.

500
00:31:57,182 --> 00:32:00,218
But that's why we're here.
To learn from the master.

501
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:03,088
Okay, I'll give it a shot.

502
00:32:19,137 --> 00:32:21,306
Yeah, guess it just depends
on work.

503
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:24,476
Frankenstein!

504
00:32:24,543 --> 00:32:26,611
Hey, how ya doin'?

505
00:32:26,678 --> 00:32:29,781
You're awesome!
Can we take a picture?
Is that okay?

506
00:32:29,848 --> 00:32:31,850
Sure, okay. Little
selfie action.

507
00:32:33,118 --> 00:32:34,118
For real?

508
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:36,321
Awesome! Thank you so much.

509
00:32:36,388 --> 00:32:37,656
Hey, have a great day.

510
00:32:38,323 --> 00:32:39,858
Boo!

511
00:32:39,925 --> 00:32:42,060
Oh. He's adorable.
He's adorable.

512
00:32:42,127 --> 00:32:44,062
Adorable, yes.

513
00:32:44,129 --> 00:32:46,998
Not scary,
but "boo" is a start.

514
00:32:57,909 --> 00:33:00,679
My birthday cake's
gonna have the coolest guy on it.

515
00:33:00,745 --> 00:33:03,081
Let me guess. Kakie.

516
00:33:03,148 --> 00:33:06,952
No. He's so cool.
He climbs walls and wears a cape.

517
00:33:07,018 --> 00:33:09,988
Oh, really. And who
is this very cool guy?

518
00:33:10,055 --> 00:33:11,723
Batman!

519
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:13,525
Batman. Great.

520
00:33:13,592 --> 00:33:16,795
You don't know anyone else
with a cape that's cool?

521
00:33:16,861 --> 00:33:17,963
This is good. Stop here.

522
00:33:24,135 --> 00:33:27,405
Okay, Wayne. It's your turn.
Go kill something.

523
00:33:27,472 --> 00:33:28,606
Denisovich, watch this.

524
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:29,908
What?

525
00:33:29,975 --> 00:33:31,276
I told you, come on.

526
00:33:31,343 --> 00:33:33,211
If we don't
inspire Denisovich,

527
00:33:33,278 --> 00:33:35,246
how's he going to
find his inner monster?

528
00:33:35,313 --> 00:33:36,648
Who's in a monster?

529
00:33:36,715 --> 00:33:38,216
Nobody, just...

530
00:33:38,283 --> 00:33:39,283
Here, have an avocado.

531
00:33:39,317 --> 00:33:40,552
Yay!

532
00:33:40,619 --> 00:33:42,620
Your mommy says
it's a good fat.

533
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:44,756
Whatever
the heaven that means.

534
00:33:44,823 --> 00:33:46,791
Listen, I'm not gonna
set monsters back again

535
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:49,361
just to make your
grandkid like vampires.

536
00:33:49,427 --> 00:33:51,547
Anyway, there's nothing to kill here.
It's all been...

537
00:33:54,899 --> 00:33:56,167
Aw...

538
00:33:56,234 --> 00:33:57,402
What a cutie.

539
00:33:58,236 --> 00:33:59,604
But kill him.

540
00:33:59,671 --> 00:34:03,274
Oh, great. You know
I haven't done this in years.

541
00:34:03,341 --> 00:34:06,244
We don't need to kill anymore.
We have pop-tarts.

542
00:34:06,311 --> 00:34:08,713
Denisovich,
you're going to love this.

543
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:11,683
Wayne's going to eat that whole deer,
and the next one's yours.

544
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:12,851
Wayne, go.

545
00:34:17,522 --> 00:34:19,824
Oh, man. I'm too old for this.

546
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:22,193
Okay, how's it go again?

547
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:25,063
No, no, wait.
That's for the moon.

548
00:34:25,130 --> 00:34:27,297
Oh, I growl. Right, here goes.

549
00:34:29,467 --> 00:34:30,768
Growl!

550
00:34:30,835 --> 00:34:31,835
Get it, boy.

551
00:34:37,542 --> 00:34:38,976
Get it, uncle Wayne.

552
00:34:41,413 --> 00:34:45,315
Some werewolf. Did you actually
say the word "growl?"

553
00:34:45,382 --> 00:34:46,784
You're a werewussy.

554
00:34:46,851 --> 00:34:48,186
I said I was rusty.

555
00:34:49,888 --> 00:34:51,523
Gimme me that frisbee.

556
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:53,024
No! It's my frisbee!
I fetched it!

557
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:54,692
Give it to me!
Give it back!

558
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:57,228
Give it over here!
Give me that! Give it back!

559
00:35:02,901 --> 00:35:04,502
He's fine.
He's blobby.

560
00:35:07,272 --> 00:35:10,175
This place is so
amazing and scenic.

561
00:35:10,241 --> 00:35:11,409
What do you
wanna show me first?

562
00:35:11,476 --> 00:35:12,777
Mmm. I don't know.

563
00:35:12,844 --> 00:35:14,279
It's pretty,
but there's really

564
00:35:14,345 --> 00:35:15,747
nothing to do
once it gets dark.

565
00:35:15,814 --> 00:35:17,215
Wait. What's that place?

566
00:35:21,719 --> 00:35:23,922
So, you're telling
me that I can pick

567
00:35:23,988 --> 00:35:25,668
between all these
different kinds of chips?

568
00:35:26,391 --> 00:35:27,559
Yes.

569
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:29,394
How do people decide?

570
00:35:30,095 --> 00:35:31,362
Whoa!

571
00:35:31,429 --> 00:35:34,232
Now what's that
beautiful fountain of rubies?

572
00:35:35,433 --> 00:35:37,402
Johnny,
have you tried this slurpee?

573
00:35:37,469 --> 00:35:39,471
Not that quickly, hon.

574
00:35:39,537 --> 00:35:42,874
It comes in 48 flavors.
We have to try them all.

575
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:47,879
Uh, I don't know
if we have time.

576
00:35:47,946 --> 00:35:50,648
Why? This place is open
all night. Right, sir?

577
00:35:50,715 --> 00:35:51,715
Yes.

578
00:35:56,321 --> 00:35:57,655
Johnny, look.

579
00:35:57,722 --> 00:36:00,859
<i>They're making a TV show about
this place and we're the stars.</i>

580
00:36:00,925 --> 00:36:02,227
<i>Hello, world.</i>

581
00:36:02,293 --> 00:36:03,695
<i>Awesome.</i>

582
00:36:03,762 --> 00:36:07,365
<i>It's totally awesome.
You're so lucky, kal.</i>

583
00:36:08,433 --> 00:36:09,968
<i>Hello, world.</i>

584
00:36:13,505 --> 00:36:15,373
Okay, Murray. Your turn.

585
00:36:16,808 --> 00:36:20,278
Excuse us. Do you know where someone
can get a bite around here?

586
00:36:20,345 --> 00:36:23,548
Did you seriously just ask a vampire
where to get a bite?

587
00:36:23,615 --> 00:36:26,084
Oh, gosh. I didn't mean...
We're not from around here.

588
00:36:26,151 --> 00:36:28,553
This is so embarrassing.
Just keep going.

589
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:30,555
Sorry to bother you.
Love your chocolate cereal.

590
00:36:34,092 --> 00:36:35,994
So, what do you
want me to do now?

591
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:37,762
Denisovich,
you won't believe it.

592
00:36:37,829 --> 00:36:40,098
The mummy can
crash through walls

593
00:36:40,165 --> 00:36:42,100
and turn into
a swarm of beetles

594
00:36:42,167 --> 00:36:44,435
and put a curse on anyone.

595
00:36:44,502 --> 00:36:45,937
That sounds mean.

596
00:36:46,004 --> 00:36:47,539
It's fun mean. Okay.

597
00:36:47,605 --> 00:36:49,207
So, check it out.

598
00:36:49,274 --> 00:36:53,811
Murray's going to conjure up
the biggest sandstorm you've ever seen.

599
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:55,547
Hit it!

600
00:36:55,613 --> 00:36:57,282
Sandstorm?
It's been awhile.

601
00:36:57,348 --> 00:36:59,317
Not my problem.
Do it. Say your little spell.

602
00:36:59,384 --> 00:37:02,086
Okay.

603
00:37:02,153 --> 00:37:05,890
I got this. Frank, Wayne, Griffin,
just try not to faint.

604
00:37:26,945 --> 00:37:27,945
Ow!

605
00:37:27,979 --> 00:37:29,214
My back.

606
00:37:38,323 --> 00:37:39,591
Oh. Wait.

607
00:37:45,997 --> 00:37:47,599
How cute!

608
00:37:48,666 --> 00:37:50,335
Ow! Ow!

609
00:37:54,572 --> 00:37:57,942
Wait. Stop at that playground.
Look at these cute kids.

610
00:38:04,649 --> 00:38:07,552
Holy rabies!
This looks like a blast.

611
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:08,987
I don't know, Mavey.

612
00:38:09,053 --> 00:38:11,889
This can be pretty dangerous
if you don't know what you're doing.

613
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:13,625
Of course, I rock these bikes.

614
00:38:13,691 --> 00:38:15,059
May I, little dude?

615
00:38:15,893 --> 00:38:18,496
Check it out. Oh, yeah.

616
00:38:18,563 --> 00:38:20,565
This is how I
rolled every summer.

617
00:38:22,634 --> 00:38:24,602
Whoo-hoo!

618
00:38:24,669 --> 00:38:25,669
Whoa, whoa!

619
00:38:35,046 --> 00:38:36,447
I think I scratched it.

620
00:38:36,514 --> 00:38:37,515
Oh...

621
00:38:37,582 --> 00:38:39,183
My turn.

622
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:42,186
Mavey, I told you,
it took me years to get this good.

623
00:38:42,253 --> 00:38:44,222
Well, I'll give it a try.

624
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:26,064
You feel me now?
That's my girlfriend, suckers.

625
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:27,465
Your wife, Johnny.

626
00:39:27,532 --> 00:39:29,233
My wife. Even better.

627
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:32,937
That was sick, lady. Where did
you learn how to do that stuff?

628
00:39:33,004 --> 00:39:34,372
Transylvania.

629
00:39:34,439 --> 00:39:37,709
That's cool. I have a cousin
from Pennsylvania.

630
00:39:37,775 --> 00:39:41,479
Oh. These little guys are so sweet.
Dennis would love them.

631
00:39:41,546 --> 00:39:43,247
What an awesome
place to raise a kid.

632
00:39:43,314 --> 00:39:45,183
Oh. To raise a kid?

633
00:39:45,249 --> 00:39:47,118
I don't know about awesome.

634
00:39:47,185 --> 00:39:50,254
<i>Maybe tubular. Capisce?</i>

635
00:39:50,321 --> 00:39:51,956
Anyways, we should
hit my folks' place.

636
00:39:52,023 --> 00:39:52,890
I said we'd be there by now.

637
00:39:52,957 --> 00:39:54,325
Sure.

638
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:56,527
Oh, hey, it's after
3:00 in Transylvania.

639
00:39:56,594 --> 00:39:58,496
I'm gonna check
on Dennis, okay?

640
00:40:03,501 --> 00:40:06,304
Chocolate cereal.
Are you kidding me?

641
00:40:06,371 --> 00:40:08,506
It's okay, Drac.
It's 'cause they love us.

642
00:40:08,573 --> 00:40:11,008
Yeah.
Monsters are what's goin' on.

643
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:13,177
Oh, yeah.
You should embrace it like I did.

644
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:15,213
I've got
a best-selling workout video.

645
00:40:15,279 --> 00:40:17,915
Follow me, ladies.
Right. And left.

646
00:40:17,982 --> 00:40:20,651
No, girls. Watch me.
You're not watching.

647
00:40:20,718 --> 00:40:23,654
Here we go. And eight
and seven and six...

648
00:40:23,721 --> 00:40:25,423
That's not me, guys.

649
00:40:25,490 --> 00:40:28,860
Come on, even bigfoot's tearin' it up
in the German soccer league.

650
00:40:36,834 --> 00:40:38,403
Oh, no. Oh, no, no, no.

651
00:40:39,170 --> 00:40:40,838
It's Mavis.

652
00:40:40,905 --> 00:40:42,640
You gotta answer it.

653
00:40:42,707 --> 00:40:44,242
You're pushin' too hard.
Lighter.

654
00:40:44,308 --> 00:40:46,344
All right!

655
00:40:46,411 --> 00:40:49,347
Denisovich, wake up.
Oh, boy, he's out cold.

656
00:40:49,414 --> 00:40:50,548
I got this.

657
00:40:53,317 --> 00:40:54,585
Dad, what took so long?

658
00:40:54,652 --> 00:40:55,953
<i>What?</i>

659
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:59,323
Nothing, Mavey.
We're all great here at the hotel.

660
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:01,392
Just doing hotel things.

661
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:02,760
Sorry,
can't handle your breath.

662
00:41:02,827 --> 00:41:04,295
I hear ya.

663
00:41:04,362 --> 00:41:05,830
How are you?

664
00:41:05,897 --> 00:41:07,432
<i>We're having a blast.</i>

665
00:41:07,498 --> 00:41:10,568
<i>We just went biking and mini-marting.
It's so fun here.</i>

666
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:12,737
<i>Is Dennis okay?</i>

667
00:41:12,804 --> 00:41:14,038
Oh. Of course.

668
00:41:14,105 --> 00:41:15,873
<i>You want to see him?</i>

669
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:17,742
Yes. Yes, I do.

670
00:41:17,809 --> 00:41:19,110
Hi, baby. How are you?

671
00:41:19,177 --> 00:41:20,745
<i>Mommy.</i>

672
00:41:20,812 --> 00:41:21,812
I happy.

673
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:23,414
Aw.

674
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:25,183
Hey, little dude.

675
00:41:25,249 --> 00:41:26,818
Why is he wearing sunglasses?

676
00:41:26,884 --> 00:41:28,953
<i>Oh, we were playing.</i>

677
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:31,789
<i>It's a superhero thing.</i>

678
00:41:31,856 --> 00:41:35,293
Cebause,
I'm sunglasses man, to the rescue!

679
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:36,961
Okay, take it down a notch.
I'm flying.

680
00:41:37,028 --> 00:41:39,564
You sound funny.

681
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:42,700
Oh, no, no, that's his
sunglasses man voice.

682
00:41:42,767 --> 00:41:45,503
Static. The signal is bad.
Mavis, are you there?

683
00:41:47,004 --> 00:41:48,004
Yeah, I'm still...

684
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:51,876
All right.
I guess he's having fun.

685
00:41:51,943 --> 00:41:53,644
Of course he is.

686
00:41:55,646 --> 00:41:58,015
Wow, I nailed it
with the sunglasses man.

687
00:41:58,082 --> 00:41:59,684
Right off the top of my head.

688
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:01,719
I threw in a "cebause."
Did everyone see that?

689
00:42:01,786 --> 00:42:04,555
She said she was having fun.
Johnny's blowing it.

690
00:42:04,622 --> 00:42:07,859
She's biking and mini-marting.
She's gonna wanna move!

691
00:42:07,925 --> 00:42:10,761
I gotta fix this kid now.
Are we almost there or what?

692
00:42:10,828 --> 00:42:12,730
Okay, I may

693
00:42:12,797 --> 00:42:14,398
have taken a wrong
turn a few miles back.

694
00:42:14,465 --> 00:42:16,267
Don't get mad.
What?

695
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:20,538
Someone turn on
the navigator on this thing.

696
00:42:20,605 --> 00:42:22,573
Look how light
I touch it.

697
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:25,576
<i>Please enter your destination.</i>

698
00:42:25,643 --> 00:42:29,280
<i>Please. I am begging you.</i>

699
00:42:31,949 --> 00:42:34,418
Yeah, this is gonna
be good, Denisovich.

700
00:42:34,485 --> 00:42:37,355
Scary stuff, okay?
It's in you.

701
00:42:37,421 --> 00:42:40,191
We just gotta
concentrate on the scary.

702
00:42:40,258 --> 00:42:43,027
Papa Drac?
Do you miss Grandma?

703
00:42:43,094 --> 00:42:45,863
Miss Grandma?
Oh. Sure, I do.

704
00:42:45,930 --> 00:42:50,201
I miss her every day.
She was my zing.

705
00:42:51,135 --> 00:42:52,603
Why do you ask?

706
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:54,071
I don't know.

707
00:42:54,138 --> 00:42:56,107
Do you miss anybody?

708
00:42:56,173 --> 00:42:58,276
I miss mommy and Daddy.

709
00:42:58,342 --> 00:43:01,112
And who else?
You miss that winnie?

710
00:43:01,178 --> 00:43:04,282
The pup who tackles you
and tries to lick you all the time?

711
00:43:04,348 --> 00:43:06,584
Yeah, but we're
just friends.

712
00:43:06,651 --> 00:43:09,453
Oh, no, no, no.
You're a Dracula.

713
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:13,324
You can't just be friends
with a cute, hairy number like winnie.

714
00:43:13,391 --> 00:43:18,996
<i>- Right turn, now!
- Here. You imbecile!</i>

715
00:43:19,063 --> 00:43:20,131
Oh, right. Turn, Griffin!

716
00:43:20,197 --> 00:43:21,365
Yes, Papa Drac.

717
00:43:26,470 --> 00:43:31,242
Wait and see, fellas. This kid'll
be guzzling goat blood in no time.

718
00:43:31,309 --> 00:43:34,679
<i>You have arrived
at your destination. Yes!</i>

719
00:43:34,745 --> 00:43:36,547
<i>Yes!
Here we are.</i>

720
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:38,983
It's the vampire summer camp
I went to as a kid.

721
00:43:39,050 --> 00:43:41,452
What's it, camp vamp?

722
00:43:41,519 --> 00:43:43,588
No. Who names
their camp "camp vamp?"

723
00:43:43,654 --> 00:43:45,823
It's camp winnepacaca.

724
00:44:06,410 --> 00:44:08,112
You see, Denisovich?

725
00:44:08,179 --> 00:44:12,249
This is where I learned
to catch mice and shapeshift.

726
00:44:12,316 --> 00:44:15,987
And use my incredible powers and strength.
It's pretty cool. Huh?

727
00:44:16,053 --> 00:44:17,053
Badminton.

728
00:44:21,592 --> 00:44:24,895
Yes, I don't
remember this badminting.

729
00:44:24,962 --> 00:44:27,932
Well, well, is this a night?
How ya doin', folks?

730
00:44:27,999 --> 00:44:29,800
I'm Dana, the director.

731
00:44:29,867 --> 00:44:32,336
We're sure excited
to have you legends visitin' us.

732
00:44:32,403 --> 00:44:34,372
What can I do you for?

733
00:44:34,438 --> 00:44:39,176
Well, I'm very interested
in sending my grandboy, Denisovich, here.

734
00:44:39,243 --> 00:44:43,714
Oh. This little redheaded,
non-fangy little guy?

735
00:44:43,781 --> 00:44:47,251
Oh, they're in there.
He's a late fanger.
That's why we came here.

736
00:44:47,318 --> 00:44:49,453
Can you show us
some of the drills,

737
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:51,589
like where they
catch the mice?

738
00:44:51,656 --> 00:44:54,625
Can do. A-course now we
call it tee-mousing.

739
00:45:05,670 --> 00:45:08,139
So they don't have
to catch the mice?

740
00:45:08,205 --> 00:45:11,676
Nope. We find this is a good way
to build their confidence.

741
00:45:13,477 --> 00:45:14,545
Come here.

742
00:45:15,846 --> 00:45:17,606
It's right there!
What's the matter with you?

743
00:45:19,383 --> 00:45:20,651
Hokey-pokey.

744
00:45:22,286 --> 00:45:23,821
Ah!

745
00:45:23,888 --> 00:45:27,258
There it is, Denisovich.
Where Papa learned to fly.

746
00:45:27,324 --> 00:45:29,360
Ooh! I wanna fly like Papa.

747
00:45:34,799 --> 00:45:35,966
Uh...

748
00:45:36,033 --> 00:45:37,768
Yeah. We're over here, now.

749
00:45:39,070 --> 00:45:41,672
Had to scale it down.
Insurance.

750
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:47,678
Help me. Help me. Help me.

751
00:45:47,745 --> 00:45:50,681
Hokey-pokey.
See ya at the campfire.

752
00:45:55,553 --> 00:45:58,189
Well, gosh! Welcome, you two.

753
00:45:58,255 --> 00:45:59,423
Hey, gang.

754
00:45:59,490 --> 00:46:02,360
Hi, guys. This is so exciting.

755
00:46:02,426 --> 00:46:06,564
Ah!
Look at all of this. So cool.

756
00:46:06,630 --> 00:46:09,166
Wow! I can't
believe I'm actually here.

757
00:46:09,233 --> 00:46:10,534
Well, you are.

758
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:13,904
Now, how does it work?
Are you up all night and sleep all day?

759
00:46:13,971 --> 00:46:15,272
Yeah.

760
00:46:15,339 --> 00:46:16,340
Oh. I'll do
whatever you guys want.

761
00:46:16,407 --> 00:46:17,942
Good.

762
00:46:18,008 --> 00:46:20,578
'Cause I bought this pretty sunhat for you.
Linda.

763
00:46:20,644 --> 00:46:22,580
But otherwise this poncho,
if you wanna be safe.

764
00:46:22,646 --> 00:46:24,415
We can deal with
it later, Linda.

765
00:46:24,482 --> 00:46:25,416
Okay.

766
00:46:25,483 --> 00:46:27,151
Oh! Come see.

767
00:46:28,319 --> 00:46:30,020
I've set up your bedroom.

768
00:46:33,991 --> 00:46:37,128
It's just like Transylvania.

769
00:46:37,194 --> 00:46:40,664
Oh, Transylvania.
That was a fun experience.

770
00:46:40,731 --> 00:46:42,800
Mike was afraid he'd get
disemboweled and eaten,

771
00:46:42,867 --> 00:46:44,802
but I told him he
was just being silly.

772
00:46:44,869 --> 00:46:46,070
That was you, Linda.

773
00:46:46,871 --> 00:46:48,773
Oh. There they are.

774
00:46:48,839 --> 00:46:51,609
You know, we have a couple
of mixed families in the neighborhood,

775
00:46:51,675 --> 00:46:53,577
so I thought I'd
invite them over.

776
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:55,679
They might be nice
for you guys to talk to

777
00:46:55,746 --> 00:46:57,481
since you're
thinkin' about moving here.

778
00:46:59,216 --> 00:47:01,352
Hi, Caren. Hi, Pandragora.

779
00:47:01,418 --> 00:47:02,920
Welcome, Mavis.
Hey, guys.

780
00:47:04,488 --> 00:47:07,725
Yeah, you're gonna dig it here.
Don't even worry.

781
00:47:07,792 --> 00:47:11,128
People are totally cool
with our lifestyle choice.

782
00:47:11,195 --> 00:47:12,496
I mean, the kids get
picked on a little,

783
00:47:12,563 --> 00:47:14,765
but it toughens them up.

784
00:47:14,832 --> 00:47:16,600
Oh, hey, you guys.
And this is Loretta.

785
00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:18,636
She's married to Paul,
who's a werewolf.

786
00:47:18,702 --> 00:47:20,304
Excuse me?

787
00:47:20,371 --> 00:47:23,808
Yes, I was telling Mavis about the
other monster-human couples in town.

788
00:47:23,874 --> 00:47:25,709
I am not a werewolf.

789
00:47:25,776 --> 00:47:28,379
Oh. I thought...

790
00:47:28,445 --> 00:47:31,048
Well, you're welcome to stay
and have some cupcakes.

791
00:47:34,685 --> 00:47:38,756
<i>♪ Vampires will
be friends forever</i>

792
00:47:38,823 --> 00:47:42,960
<i>♪ Through
the centuries together</i>

793
00:47:43,027 --> 00:47:47,231
<i>♪ Even in

00:47:47,298 --> 00:47:51,435
<i>♪ Vampires will

795
00:47:51,502 --> 00:47:55,039
<i>♪ Literally</i>

796
00:47:55,105 --> 00:47:58,409
<i>♪ Forever</i>

797
00:48:02,246 --> 00:48:05,015
great job, vampires.
Give yourselves a hug.

798
00:48:05,082 --> 00:48:06,082
Mmm...

799
00:48:11,121 --> 00:48:12,156
We're going.

800
00:48:12,223 --> 00:48:13,223
What? Where?

801
00:48:19,597 --> 00:48:21,031
Why are we doing this?

802
00:48:21,098 --> 00:48:23,901
You'd rather be listening
to those putrid new songs?

803
00:48:23,968 --> 00:48:26,003
<i>What happened to
Michael row your corpse ashore?</i>

804
00:48:26,070 --> 00:48:28,639
<i>Or old mcwerewolf had an axe?</i>

805
00:48:34,044 --> 00:48:35,880
We shouldn't be up here, Drac.

806
00:48:35,946 --> 00:48:37,948
Who's ready to fly?

807
00:48:38,015 --> 00:48:40,217
Me! Me! Like a superhero.

808
00:48:40,284 --> 00:48:42,086
Better! Like a vampire!

809
00:48:43,020 --> 00:48:44,922
This thing is rickety.

810
00:48:44,989 --> 00:48:47,291
You know what?
Maybe the kid isn't supposed to fly.

811
00:48:47,358 --> 00:48:50,628
Quiet. This is how they learn.
You throw them and they figure it out.

812
00:48:51,595 --> 00:48:53,163
It's how I was taught.

813
00:48:53,230 --> 00:48:54,598
I wanna fly now!

814
00:48:54,665 --> 00:48:58,002
Attabat. You know Papa's right here
if you need him.

815
00:48:58,068 --> 00:48:59,503
Uh. I can't watch this.

816
00:48:59,570 --> 00:49:01,071
Please don't.

817
00:49:01,138 --> 00:49:03,607
Here we go!

818
00:49:03,674 --> 00:49:04,674
Wee!

819
00:49:09,947 --> 00:49:11,215
He's still not flying.

820
00:49:11,282 --> 00:49:12,283
He will.

821
00:49:13,617 --> 00:49:15,085
Still not.

822
00:49:15,152 --> 00:49:16,152
It'll happen.

823
00:49:17,321 --> 00:49:18,689
This is a tall tower.

824
00:49:18,756 --> 00:49:20,224
That's why it's good.

825
00:49:20,291 --> 00:49:21,558
You should get him.

826
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:22,693
He's gonna fall to his death.

827
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:24,628
He's taking his time.

828
00:49:26,096 --> 00:49:27,598
Drac!

829
00:49:27,665 --> 00:49:29,566
I did that my first time.

830
00:49:29,633 --> 00:49:31,235
He's getting too
close to the ground!

831
00:49:32,636 --> 00:49:34,038
You know what?
He's not gonna fly.

832
00:49:41,612 --> 00:49:42,613
Ah.

833
00:49:44,682 --> 00:49:47,685
I told you.
Papa's always here for you.

834
00:49:47,751 --> 00:49:50,020
Again! Again!

835
00:49:50,087 --> 00:49:52,756
Oh, dear. Oh, my devil.
We're gonna have to report this.

836
00:49:52,823 --> 00:49:54,391
You mean to the papers?

837
00:49:54,458 --> 00:49:57,828
I guess it was pretty cool,
but I'm not about getting press.

838
00:49:57,895 --> 00:50:00,364
No, sir.
I mean the authorities.

839
00:50:00,431 --> 00:50:02,866
I can't not report
child endangerment.

840
00:50:02,933 --> 00:50:05,703
Whoa!
Listen to me. That was fun.

841
00:50:05,769 --> 00:50:08,138
Your singing is
child endangerment.

842
00:50:08,205 --> 00:50:10,207
Should we go
down and help him?

843
00:50:10,274 --> 00:50:13,110
Nope. I told him this was nuts.
He's on his own.

844
00:50:13,177 --> 00:50:14,678
We have to call
the boy's mother.

845
00:50:14,745 --> 00:50:16,280
No, that ain't happening.

846
00:50:16,347 --> 00:50:18,916
His mother's
already nutsy koo koo!

847
00:50:18,983 --> 00:50:21,585
I have to follow protocol.

848
00:50:21,652 --> 00:50:25,222
You will not follow protocol.

849
00:50:25,289 --> 00:50:27,224
I'm a vampire.
I can't be hypnotized.

850
00:50:28,025 --> 00:50:29,226
Right.

851
00:50:29,293 --> 00:50:31,795
Now, please. Don't
make me call the police.

852
00:50:31,862 --> 00:50:33,664
No one's calling nobody!

853
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:36,599
Aah!

854
00:50:36,633 --> 00:50:38,202
Fire!

855
00:50:38,268 --> 00:50:41,071
Stop, drop and roll.
Stop, drop and roll.

856
00:50:41,138 --> 00:50:42,473
Screaming's not helping!

857
00:50:42,539 --> 00:50:43,539
Yay!

858
00:50:51,148 --> 00:50:52,950
Are we bad guys, Papa Drac?

859
00:50:53,584 --> 00:50:54,584
Bad?

860
00:50:56,387 --> 00:50:59,156
No. You're
the best kid in the world.

861
00:50:59,223 --> 00:51:02,559
We didn't start the fire.
It was the tower.

862
00:51:02,626 --> 00:51:07,097
That's a very unsafe tower.
You're lucky we don't call the authorities.

863
00:51:07,164 --> 00:51:08,966
Let's go, my hero.

864
00:51:09,033 --> 00:51:11,769
Cebause I'm Batman!
To the Batmobile!

865
00:51:11,835 --> 00:51:13,337
Yes. To the...

866
00:51:24,815 --> 00:51:27,451
Sorry about all that stuff.
I guess they thought you'd like it.

867
00:51:27,518 --> 00:51:29,620
Why do I feel so weird here?

868
00:51:29,686 --> 00:51:31,822
No, hon. They're being weird.

869
00:51:31,889 --> 00:51:34,291
I think they're
just trying to help me.

870
00:51:34,358 --> 00:51:37,828
I mean, I grew up knowing nothing
living inside that hotel.

871
00:51:37,895 --> 00:51:40,831
And you learned about everything
growing up in Santa Claus.

872
00:51:40,898 --> 00:51:43,367
Santa Cruz. But, uh...

873
00:51:43,434 --> 00:51:46,203
Maybe if Dennis grows up
away from Transylvania,

874
00:51:46,270 --> 00:51:50,240
he won't be so freaky.
Like me.

875
00:51:50,307 --> 00:51:53,777
Are you nuts?
Mavis, you're a blast.

876
00:51:53,844 --> 00:51:56,680
You're so full of life
and curious about everything.

877
00:51:56,747 --> 00:51:58,982
If Dennis grows up
to be just like you,

878
00:51:59,049 --> 00:52:01,151
I'll be
the luckiest Dad in the world.

879
00:52:01,218 --> 00:52:04,288
I love you,
Johnnystein.

880
00:52:04,354 --> 00:52:05,689
You know what?

881
00:52:05,756 --> 00:52:08,659
As long as we're all together,
we'll be happy anywhere.

882
00:52:08,726 --> 00:52:10,194
Even at the hotel.

883
00:52:11,361 --> 00:52:12,963
Yes!

884
00:52:15,432 --> 00:52:16,767
What are you doing?

885
00:52:16,834 --> 00:52:19,303
Check out this
video my friend sent me.

886
00:52:19,369 --> 00:52:21,371
This kid is
an awesome daredevil.

887
00:52:22,473 --> 00:52:23,607
Ah.

888
00:52:23,674 --> 00:52:24,575
<i>Oh, dude!</i>

889
00:52:24,641 --> 00:52:25,709
<i>Did you get it?</i>

890
00:52:25,776 --> 00:52:27,010
Wait! Is that Dennis?

891
00:52:27,077 --> 00:52:31,782
No! Is it?
No. It's just hard to see.
But...

892
00:52:31,849 --> 00:52:34,351
Oops. Just deleted it.
So, it's gone.

893
00:52:44,928 --> 00:52:46,997
What? It's Mavis.
I'm not answering it.

894
00:52:49,032 --> 00:52:51,001
Come on, Drac. You have to.

895
00:52:53,604 --> 00:52:55,272
All right!

896
00:52:55,339 --> 00:52:56,840
Yes, honeybunch.

897
00:52:56,907 --> 00:52:58,509
<i>Dad? Where are you?</i>

898
00:52:58,575 --> 00:53:02,546
Um... we're outside the hotel
having a little cookout.

899
00:53:02,613 --> 00:53:04,248
It's perfectly safe.

900
00:53:04,314 --> 00:53:05,849
What's that noise?
Is that a siren?

901
00:53:05,916 --> 00:53:09,086
Oh, those are just some
wailing banshees checking in.

902
00:53:09,153 --> 00:53:10,954
<i>Quiet, you banshees.</i>

903
00:53:11,021 --> 00:53:13,757
We're trying to have
a perfectly safe cookout over here.

904
00:53:13,824 --> 00:53:17,427
Mommy!
I wanna say hi! Mommy! Mommy!

905
00:53:17,494 --> 00:53:18,929
Papa Drac just tried
to teach me how to fly.

906
00:53:18,996 --> 00:53:20,430
Wait a minute.
Is that the mother?

907
00:53:20,497 --> 00:53:21,932
<i>Oh, no. Static again.</i>

908
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:25,135
I am coming back to
the hotel right now.

909
00:53:25,202 --> 00:53:29,306
And you better be there or I swear, Dad,
you're gonna be very sorry.

910
00:53:30,107 --> 00:53:32,075
What's goin' on?

911
00:53:32,142 --> 00:53:33,377
We need to get
home right away.

912
00:53:33,443 --> 00:53:34,443
Whoa!

913
00:53:35,846 --> 00:53:38,482
Okay.
I'll go wake up my backpack.

914
00:53:38,549 --> 00:53:40,083
Guys, we gotta move.

915
00:53:40,150 --> 00:53:42,519
We got no car!
How we gonna get out of here?

916
00:53:42,586 --> 00:53:44,087
Don't worry.
I made a call.

917
00:53:53,597 --> 00:53:56,567
I'm sorry, blobby.
We really meant to call you sooner.

918
00:54:03,106 --> 00:54:04,341
Hit it!

919
00:54:19,656 --> 00:54:20,757
Transylvania.

920
00:54:20,824 --> 00:54:22,159
You want to go where?

921
00:54:22,226 --> 00:54:23,594
Transylvania.
As soon as possible.

922
00:54:23,660 --> 00:54:25,662
We don't fly
direct to Transylvania.

923
00:54:25,729 --> 00:54:27,097
You don't?

924
00:54:27,164 --> 00:54:29,366
You can go to Bucharest,
but you'll have to

925
00:54:29,433 --> 00:54:31,268
switch planes in
Chicago and then Zurich.

926
00:54:31,335 --> 00:54:33,003
So, when would we get there?

927
00:54:33,070 --> 00:54:36,073
Well, the Chicago flight's delayed
due to bad weather.

928
00:54:41,645 --> 00:54:43,247
So, two seats in coach?

929
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:44,680
No!

930
00:54:45,215 --> 00:54:46,650
No!
Yes.

931
00:55:06,770 --> 00:55:09,740
You have to go now?
When we finally have no traffic.

932
00:55:09,806 --> 00:55:11,408
You're killing me, Blobby.

933
00:55:21,418 --> 00:55:24,421
I still have some cloud on me.
Gotta do a selfie!

934
00:55:24,488 --> 00:55:25,989
Johnny! Not now!

935
00:55:26,056 --> 00:55:27,291
Okay. Maybe later.

936
00:55:33,630 --> 00:55:36,099
This scooter thing's out of juice.
We're never gonna make it.

937
00:55:36,166 --> 00:55:37,601
Frank, blow.

938
00:55:47,044 --> 00:55:48,145
Now!

939
00:56:11,034 --> 00:56:14,237
How fun is this?
Why are you laughing?
You like that?

940
00:56:14,304 --> 00:56:15,572
Watch this.

941
00:56:17,374 --> 00:56:18,494
Coochie-coochie-coochie-coo!

942
00:56:27,451 --> 00:56:29,252
Now this is flying,
Denisovich.

943
00:56:29,319 --> 00:56:31,455
Like a vampire.

944
00:56:32,923 --> 00:56:33,923
Wee!

945
00:56:35,125 --> 00:56:37,828
That's my boy. Look at you go.

946
00:56:46,970 --> 00:56:50,240
You're the coolest guy
who wears a cape, Papa Drac.

947
00:57:02,619 --> 00:57:03,619
Ugh!

948
00:57:18,935 --> 00:57:21,638
So, hey, when are you going
to get here already?

949
00:57:21,705 --> 00:57:23,306
We've been waiting...

950
00:57:25,342 --> 00:57:27,477
Give me my son.

951
00:57:27,544 --> 00:57:29,913
We just went out
for some avocados.

952
00:57:29,980 --> 00:57:31,448
Mommy! I flew!

953
00:57:31,515 --> 00:57:33,150

Now I don't even feel like
he's safe around you.

964
00:58:02,279 --> 00:58:03,447
But I was just...

965
00:58:03,513 --> 00:58:04,881

966
00:58:04,948 --> 00:58:08,351

Please, Mavey. Don't leave.

971
00:58:17,961 --> 00:58:21,097
Maybe you've let humans
into your hotel, Dad.

972
00:58:21,164 --> 00:58:23,333

excited about your big party?

981
00:59:25,762 --> 00:59:27,564
I guess so.

982
00:59:27,631 --> 00:59:30,567

Daddy's whole family.

No. Dennis, of course not.

01:02:42,258 --> 01:02:44,461
Or any of your family.

1040
01:02:44,527 --> 01:02:46,963
What? But, Drac,
I'm proud that we're...

1041
01:02:47,030 --> 01:02:49,799
Or he'll steal your family's souls
and eat your backpack.

1042
01:02:52,335 --> 01:02:53,903
That's right, gang.

1043
01:02:53,970 --> 01:02:56,906
We're gonna make the birthday
a monster masquerade party.

1044
01:02:57,841 --> 01:03:00,076
Really?
Oh, that's lovely.

1045
01:03:00,143 --> 01:03:04,614
Sort of like a last hurrah before
Dennis gets to be with normal people.

1046
01:03:04,681 --> 01:03:06,716
I couldn't have
said it better.

1047
01:03:26,402 --> 01:03:30,039
What do you think, Mavis?
I think I'm starting to like being creepy.

1048
01:03:35,145 --> 01:03:37,680
You're lucky we don't
call the authorities.

1049
01:03:37,747 --> 01:03:39,649
Let's go, my hero.

1050
01:03:39,716 --> 01:03:41,217
Cebause I'm Batman!

1051
01:03:42,418 --> 01:03:44,554
Yes! To the Batmobile!

1052
01:03:50,460 --> 01:03:52,061
Got your butt
kicked by a girl, Batman.

1053
01:03:54,964 --> 01:03:57,534
Yeah. Whatever.
I'm not about to cry.

1054
01:04:01,104 --> 01:04:04,407
Hotel Transylvania.

1055
01:04:04,474 --> 01:04:07,944
I smell humans!

1056
01:04:08,011 --> 01:04:10,980
Tear it down!

1057
01:04:11,047 --> 01:04:15,585
Bela, we're in the outside world.
You're gonna smell humans.

1058
01:04:15,652 --> 01:04:19,189
You know what? Just wait outside for me.
This is family stuff.

1059
01:04:19,255 --> 01:04:20,857
You'll only get in the way.

1060
01:04:20,924 --> 01:04:22,725
I just wanna meet
the little fanger.

1061
01:04:22,792 --> 01:04:24,260
He should know
his great-vampa.

1062
01:04:24,327 --> 01:04:25,995
His what?

1063
01:04:26,062 --> 01:04:29,265
Vampire Grandpa. Come on.
That was obvious.

1064
01:04:31,835 --> 01:04:33,469
Amazing party!

1065
01:04:33,536 --> 01:04:36,372
So, what do you think?

1066
01:04:36,439 --> 01:04:38,942
This is your vampire costume?
What are you, nuts?

1067
01:04:39,008 --> 01:04:40,476
I ordered it online.

1068
01:04:40,543 --> 01:04:42,445
It was the only place
that delivered overnight.

1069
01:04:42,512 --> 01:04:44,914
You look like you got
a baboon's butt on your head.

1070
01:04:44,981 --> 01:04:46,916
Have you at least
practiced your voice?

1071
01:04:46,983 --> 01:04:48,985
You can't just
talk like a hippie.

1072
01:04:49,052 --> 01:04:50,687
I'm not a hippie.
I'm a slacker.

1073
01:04:50,753 --> 01:04:53,122
Talk like a vampire.

1074
01:04:53,189 --> 01:04:58,695
My name is Count Jonafang.
I am a vampire.

1075
01:04:58,761 --> 01:05:02,398
Okay, vampires don't go around saying,
"I am a vampire."

1076
01:05:02,465 --> 01:05:06,836
Sorry. I am Count Jonafang.
Bleh, bleh-bleh.

1077
01:05:06,903 --> 01:05:08,304
Are you kidding me?

1078
01:05:08,371 --> 01:05:09,839
I'm sorry. I'm nervous.

1079
01:05:09,906 --> 01:05:12,008
Yeah, listen,
if you think I don't like it,

1080
01:05:12,075 --> 01:05:14,010
you definitely
don't want to say,

1081
01:05:14,077 --> 01:05:15,845
"bleh, bleh-bleh,"
in front of my father.

1082
01:05:15,912 --> 01:05:17,347
Sir, Master Kakie
has arrived.

1083
01:05:17,413 --> 01:05:19,148
Oh, hey.

1084
01:05:19,215 --> 01:05:22,118
Drac, this is Brandon, A.K.A.
Kakie.

1085
01:05:22,185 --> 01:05:24,187
We got him for Dennis.
Hey, man.

1086
01:05:24,254 --> 01:05:26,256
Nauseated to meet you.

1087
01:05:26,322 --> 01:05:28,658
When does this happen?
I got a book fair in half an hour.

1088
01:05:32,529 --> 01:05:34,898
All right. Where's my vampson?

1089
01:05:37,634 --> 01:05:40,737
Oh, please. Still has to make
a dramatic entrance.

1090
01:05:40,803 --> 01:05:43,439
Dad! Look at you!

1091
01:05:43,506 --> 01:05:45,942
So you run a hotel now?

1092
01:05:46,009 --> 01:05:49,779
From prince of darkness
to king of room service.

1093
01:05:49,846 --> 01:05:51,915
Yes. So good to see you.

1094
01:05:51,981 --> 01:05:53,816
I'll be right with you.

1095
01:05:59,055 --> 01:06:01,925
Keep Vlad away from
the humans and Mavis.

1096
01:06:02,892 --> 01:06:03,960
I'm on it.

1097
01:06:04,894 --> 01:06:08,364
Oh, now that is
a neat costume.

1098
01:06:08,431 --> 01:06:10,900
These two smell funny.

1099
01:06:10,967 --> 01:06:12,568
Oh, you're European.

1100
01:06:12,635 --> 01:06:15,204
It's called deodorant.

1101
01:06:15,271 --> 01:06:18,308
Nothing like insulting
an entire continent, Linda.

1102
01:06:18,374 --> 01:06:20,443
Hey, count!
How goes it? Frankenstein.

1103
01:06:20,510 --> 01:06:22,679
Actually, I'm technically
Frankenstein's monster.

1104
01:06:22,745 --> 01:06:24,145
Frankenstein,
he's the doctor who...

1105
01:06:24,180 --> 01:06:27,583
Would love to hear more.
Call my people.

1106
01:06:27,650 --> 01:06:30,050
So, let me introduce you
to some of your son's other buddies.

1107
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:32,622
This is Murray.

1108
01:06:32,689 --> 01:06:34,357
Please don't kill me!

1109
01:06:34,424 --> 01:06:37,226
I mean, yo, v! What's up?

1110
01:06:37,293 --> 01:06:40,096
Talking toilet paper.
Well, that's a new one.

1111
01:06:41,464 --> 01:06:43,733
All right! Where's the kid?
That's who I wanna meet.

1112
01:06:43,800 --> 01:06:45,034
Johnny!

1113
01:06:47,937 --> 01:06:50,807
This is Dracula's son-in-law.

1114
01:06:50,873 --> 01:06:54,711
I am Count Jonafang.

1115
01:06:54,777 --> 01:06:57,180
Bleh, bleh, black sheep.

1116
01:06:57,246 --> 01:07:00,216
Have you any wool?

1117
01:07:00,283 --> 01:07:02,118
What's that
thing on your head?

1118
01:07:02,185 --> 01:07:04,554
Looks like my
Grandmother's boobies.

1119
01:07:07,223 --> 01:07:09,292
Daddy, who's the man
with the funny face?

1120
01:07:09,359 --> 01:07:10,560
Is this the kid?

1121
01:07:10,626 --> 01:07:11,794
It sure is.

1122
01:07:11,861 --> 01:07:13,496
Let me see those fangs.

1123
01:07:13,563 --> 01:07:14,797
What are you doin'?

1124
01:07:14,864 --> 01:07:16,699
Oh, I just love him so much.

1125
01:07:16,766 --> 01:07:19,736
I want to hug him
right in the fangs that he has.

1126
01:07:22,005 --> 01:07:25,308
I repeat,
lemme see those fangs.

1127
01:07:34,984 --> 01:07:38,087
Oh, he's a late fanger,
just like you.

1128
01:07:38,154 --> 01:07:40,390
Yes. Yes.
Just like me.

1129
01:07:42,625 --> 01:07:45,328
The big shot here
was a little crybaby, all right.

1130
01:07:45,395 --> 01:07:46,663
Yes, yes, I was.

1131
01:07:46,729 --> 01:07:47,830
Used to pee in his bed.

1132
01:07:47,897 --> 01:07:49,365
Okay, Dad.

1133
01:07:49,432 --> 01:07:52,235
We just need to scare
the fangs out of the kid.

1134
01:07:52,301 --> 01:07:53,936
Hare ha hangs?

1135
01:07:54,003 --> 01:07:56,672
Yeah, it's what I did
for Mr. tough guy here.

1136
01:07:56,739 --> 01:07:59,242
First, you've got
to possess something

1137
01:07:59,308 --> 01:08:01,744
the late fanger
finds sweet and innocent.

1138
01:08:01,811 --> 01:08:03,413
Then you show them
what's what and...

1139
01:08:03,479 --> 01:08:05,481
Pop!

1140
01:08:05,548 --> 01:08:09,652
Trust me. It'll scare
the fangs right out. Right, Drac?

1141
01:08:09,719 --> 01:08:13,089
Seriously, guys, if I'm late for the
book fair, I'll miss the street fair.

1142
01:08:13,956 --> 01:08:16,292
That's your guy.

1143
01:08:16,359 --> 01:08:19,162
Possessed?
But Dennis will be so upset.

1144
01:08:19,228 --> 01:08:21,330
Don't you get it?
This is our ticket.

1145
01:08:21,397 --> 01:08:24,200
If it works for Denisovich,
boom! He's a vampire.

1146
01:08:24,267 --> 01:08:26,102
And you all get to stay here.

1147
01:08:26,169 --> 01:08:27,837
All right. All right.

1148
01:08:28,871 --> 01:08:30,807
<i>Capisce.
Good call.</i>

1149
01:08:30,872 --> 01:08:33,910
Kids, everyone, have a seat.

1150
01:08:33,975 --> 01:08:36,412
Dennis has a big
surprise for you.

1151
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:40,817
The one and only Kakie,
the cake monster!

1152
01:08:40,883 --> 01:08:44,821
Hey, kids! It's me, Kakie!

1153
01:08:44,886 --> 01:08:48,224
What a wonderful
Kakie day it is!

1154
01:08:48,291 --> 01:08:52,127
Now, I have a question.
Who here loves cake?

1155
01:08:57,633 --> 01:08:58,633
Rise!

1156
01:08:59,435 --> 01:09:00,435
Whoa, whoa...

1157
01:09:07,076 --> 01:09:09,779
Why am I floating?
Can I have the stage manager, please?

1158
01:09:09,845 --> 01:09:11,613
This isn't working for me.

1159
01:09:11,680 --> 01:09:12,680
Whoa...

1160
01:09:16,051 --> 01:09:18,187
Wow!

1161
01:09:18,254 --> 01:09:21,357
Scary, Denisovich?
You feeling anything?
Any change?

1162
01:09:21,424 --> 01:09:22,859
Is Kakie okay?

1163
01:09:25,228 --> 01:09:29,332
I want all the cake.
Sharing is for cowards.

1164
01:09:32,033 --> 01:09:35,438
I don't remember any of this
from the TV show.

1165
01:09:35,505 --> 01:09:38,341
Um... I think I saw it
on a blu-ray disc, bonus stuff.

1166
01:09:38,407 --> 01:09:40,510
Wait,
why is Grandpa Vlad up there?

1167
01:09:46,983 --> 01:09:49,484
I'm scared, Papa.
What's happening to Kakie?

1168
01:09:54,223 --> 01:09:57,627
You don't eat cake.
Cake eat you!

1169
01:09:57,693 --> 01:09:59,128
No!

1170
01:09:59,195 --> 01:10:00,296
Stop it!

1171
01:10:03,699 --> 01:10:06,636
- What just happened, man?
- I'm outta here.

1172
01:10:06,702 --> 01:10:10,039
None of these parents
better review this on yelp.

1173
01:10:10,106 --> 01:10:11,908
Hey, what did you just do?

1174
01:10:11,974 --> 01:10:14,443
A few more seconds and the kid's fangs
would have popped right out.

1175
01:10:14,510 --> 01:10:16,045
I don't care.
It's not worth it.

1176
01:10:16,112 --> 01:10:18,080
What's not worth it?

1177
01:10:18,147 --> 01:10:21,551
It was my last attempt to make
the boy a vampire, so you'd stay.

1178
01:10:21,617 --> 01:10:24,587
By ruining his favorite thing?
How could you do that?

1179
01:10:24,654 --> 01:10:25,721
We were desperate.

1180
01:10:25,788 --> 01:10:27,657
You were in on this?

1181
01:10:27,723 --> 01:10:29,158
Dennis won't be
happy in my town.

1182
01:10:29,225 --> 01:10:30,993
Dennis hasn't been there.

1183
01:10:31,060 --> 01:10:33,329
<i>♪ Now husband and wife</i>

1184
01:10:33,396 --> 01:10:35,431
<i>♪ Feel the strain
and the strife ♪</i>

1185
01:10:35,498 --> 01:10:37,200
Shut up!

1186
01:10:37,266 --> 01:10:39,468
Johnny,
Dennis is not a monster.

1187
01:10:40,903 --> 01:10:43,039
He likes avocado.

1188
01:10:43,105 --> 01:10:44,607
'Cause you don't let
him eat anything fun.

1189
01:10:44,674 --> 01:10:46,842
I think Dennis just
wants to be normal.

1190
01:10:46,909 --> 01:10:49,245
Can we stop using
the word "normal"?

1191
01:10:49,312 --> 01:10:51,581
Where we live now,
he's normal.

1192
01:10:51,647 --> 01:10:55,418
He is who he is.
And you can't change him, Dad.

1193
01:10:58,387 --> 01:10:59,822
Dennis, where are you going?

1194
01:10:59,889 --> 01:11:01,224
Away.

1195
01:11:03,025 --> 01:11:05,394
But it's not safe
out here by yourself.

1196
01:11:05,461 --> 01:11:08,431
I know a place where
we can hide. Follow me.

1197
01:11:14,870 --> 01:11:16,339
If you didn't stop me,

1198
01:11:16,405 --> 01:11:19,508
my great-grandson wouldn't
have to be a wimp his whole life

1199
01:11:19,575 --> 01:11:21,177
like schlumpy over here.

1200
01:11:21,244 --> 01:11:23,112
A wimp?
Johnny, be cool.

1201
01:11:23,179 --> 01:11:25,248
You wanna throw down, old man?

1202
01:11:25,314 --> 01:11:26,949
Certified yellow
belt since 1997.

1203
01:11:27,016 --> 01:11:29,185
No!

1204
01:11:29,252 --> 01:11:31,354
What's this now?
You're not a vampire?

1205
01:11:31,420 --> 01:11:33,923
Bleh?

1206
01:11:33,990 --> 01:11:38,160
Of course he's human.
He's our son. You think we're monsters?

1207
01:11:41,697 --> 01:11:46,502
You! You let your daughter marry a human
and have a human kid?

1208
01:11:46,569 --> 01:11:49,739
Why don't you just
put a stake through my heart.

1209
01:11:49,805 --> 01:11:52,942
We don't hate humans anymore,
and they don't hate us.

1210
01:11:56,712 --> 01:11:58,614
Humans?

1211
01:12:00,049 --> 01:12:01,450
You're a fool.

1212
01:12:01,517 --> 01:12:04,186
Your great-grandson is
the sweetest, kindest,

1213
01:12:04,253 --> 01:12:07,023
most special
boy I've ever met.

1214
01:12:07,089 --> 01:12:09,158
And if you can't
give him the love

1215
01:12:09,225 --> 01:12:10,926
he deserves
because he's half-human,

1216
01:12:10,993 --> 01:12:12,328
then you're the fool.

1217
01:12:13,863 --> 01:12:14,863
Oh, Daddy.

1218
01:12:17,199 --> 01:12:18,601
Hey, where is Dennis?
Dennis!

1219
01:12:19,869 --> 01:12:20,869
Dennis?

1220
01:12:24,206 --> 01:12:27,176
Happy birthday, Dennis.
I made you a treat.

1221
01:12:27,243 --> 01:12:29,445
Dead pigeon?
Enjoy it.

1222
01:12:29,512 --> 01:12:32,281
'Cause once I graduate business school
and start running a company,

1223
01:12:32,348 --> 01:12:35,217
you're not gonna get home-cooked
meals like this anymore.

1224
01:12:35,284 --> 01:12:38,654
I have to move away, winnie.
To California.

1225
01:12:38,721 --> 01:12:41,490
My mommy thinks
I'm not happy here

1226
01:12:41,557 --> 01:12:44,026
cebause I don't have
hair on my face like you.

1227
01:12:44,093 --> 01:12:46,495
I'm sorry I'm not a monster.

1228
01:12:46,562 --> 01:12:49,932
No, you are perfect.
You're the nicest boy I know.

1229
01:12:49,999 --> 01:12:51,967
And I have 300 brothers.

1230
01:12:52,034 --> 01:12:54,103
You're nice, too, winnie.

1231
01:12:58,374 --> 01:13:03,713
Well, well, well.
The little human and his pet.

1232
01:13:03,779 --> 01:13:05,581
Dennis!
Denisovich!

1233
01:13:05,648 --> 01:13:06,849
He's not in the room.

1234
01:13:06,916 --> 01:13:08,384
He's not by the pool.

1235
01:13:08,451 --> 01:13:10,086
He's not in this pot of soup.

1236
01:13:10,152 --> 01:13:12,121
Where could he be?

1237
01:13:12,188 --> 01:13:14,357
I don't know why I
ever invited you.

1238
01:13:15,157 --> 01:13:16,692
Dennis!
Dennis!

1239
01:13:16,759 --> 01:13:17,759
Denisovich!

1240
01:13:17,793 --> 01:13:18,793
Dennis!

1241
01:13:31,207 --> 01:13:33,008
Stop squirming.

1242
01:13:33,075 --> 01:13:35,077
Why are you doing this?

1243
01:13:35,144 --> 01:13:37,113
Because this is wrong.

1244
01:13:37,179 --> 01:13:39,515
Why doesn't anybody get that?

1245
01:13:39,582 --> 01:13:42,685
Humans don't
belong with monsters.

1246
01:13:42,752 --> 01:13:44,053
You're wrong!

1247
01:13:44,120 --> 01:13:45,521
I am not!

1248
01:13:45,588 --> 01:13:48,424
I am holding you hostage.

1249
01:13:48,491 --> 01:13:53,662
And me and my crew are gonna
tear that human-hugging hotel to shreds.

1250
01:13:53,729 --> 01:13:55,231
You can't.

1251
01:13:55,297 --> 01:13:56,966
Really? Why not?

1252
01:13:57,032 --> 01:13:58,234
Cebause...

1253
01:13:58,300 --> 01:13:59,435
Cebause, why?

1254
01:14:00,369 --> 01:14:03,539
Cebause it will
make Papa Drac sad.

1255
01:14:03,606 --> 01:14:07,376
Ooh... sad. And what are you
gonna do about it?

1256
01:14:07,443 --> 01:14:09,445
I don't know.

1257
01:14:09,512 --> 01:14:11,480
You know why you don't know?

1258
01:14:11,547 --> 01:14:15,684
Cebause you're just
a weak little boy.

1259
01:14:46,182 --> 01:14:47,683
What was that?

1260
01:14:47,750 --> 01:14:49,318
Dennis, we're coming.

1261
01:14:51,020 --> 01:14:52,688
Are you okay, winnie?

1262
01:14:52,755 --> 01:14:54,123
Yes, my zing.

1263
01:15:30,559 --> 01:15:31,660
Dennis!
There he is, right there.

1264
01:15:31,727 --> 01:15:33,162
Dennis! Baby!

1265
01:15:33,229 --> 01:15:34,763
My big boy!

1266
01:15:34,830 --> 01:15:35,965
Dennis,
we were lookin' for ya.

1267
01:15:36,031 --> 01:15:37,333
Sweetheart.

1268
01:15:37,399 --> 01:15:38,399
I'm so happy to see you.

1269
01:15:42,104 --> 01:15:43,506
There's his mean friends.

1270
01:15:50,279 --> 01:15:52,281
Oh... this'll be fun.

1271
01:16:05,294 --> 01:16:06,328
Whoo!

1272
01:16:25,714 --> 01:16:26,715
Huh?

1273
01:16:53,275 --> 01:16:54,643
I didn't do that.

1274
01:17:06,322 --> 01:17:07,823
You rock, Dennis.

1275
01:17:07,890 --> 01:17:08,991
He means Denisovich.

1276
01:17:09,058 --> 01:17:10,326
Kakie rules!

1277
01:17:21,070 --> 01:17:22,504
Dennis, I'm coming. Whoa...

1278
01:17:27,910 --> 01:17:29,812
I knew all that
practice would pay off.

1279
01:17:53,969 --> 01:17:56,305
That's right,
you better fly away.

1280
01:17:57,873 --> 01:18:01,410
Papa Drac, I'm
a vampire and a superhero.

1281
01:18:01,477 --> 01:18:03,345
Am I cool now?

1282
01:18:03,412 --> 01:18:06,915
"Now"?
Dennis, you were always cool.

1283
01:18:06,982 --> 01:18:11,687
Human, vampire, unicorn,
you're perfect no matter what.

1284
01:18:11,754 --> 01:18:15,057
But since I'm a vampire,
can we stay here?

1285
01:18:15,924 --> 01:18:17,126
Yes.

1286
01:18:17,192 --> 01:18:18,360
All right! Yeah!

1287
01:18:18,427 --> 01:18:19,528
All right!

1288
01:18:21,830 --> 01:18:25,901
But you have to know, we're going to visit
you here every holiday.

1289
01:18:25,968 --> 01:18:27,970
That's fine.
That's fine.

1290
01:18:37,446 --> 01:18:38,447
Aah!

1291
01:18:43,752 --> 01:18:47,690
Don't ever come near
me or my family again.

1292
01:18:51,193 --> 01:18:52,361
No!

1293
01:19:01,537 --> 01:19:05,474
Daddy, you just
saved a human.

1294
01:19:05,541 --> 01:19:07,876
All this pressure about

1295
01:19:07,943 --> 01:19:10,312
when the boy's
fangs were coming out.

1296
01:19:10,379 --> 01:19:13,649
Who cares? Mine came
out years ago! Look.

1297
01:19:15,751 --> 01:19:18,721
Okay, Dad, put 'em back
in before we all barf.

1298
01:19:18,787 --> 01:19:22,391
Hey! Isn't it still
somebody's birthday?

1299
01:20:18,547 --> 01:20:20,048
Let me hear you sing!

1300
01:20:22,184 --> 01:20:23,519
I didn't do that.
